        "interviewer": "Hello! It's nice to meet you too. Thank you for taking the time to speak with me today about the Entry-Level IT Support Engineer role. To start off, could you tell me about your experience with Microsoft Windows, particularly in troubleshooting and resolving issues?",
        "candidate": " Sure, I've used Microsoft Windows for over 10 years now at a technical level and at my last role as an IT support engineer at G-Research, I frequently had to troubleshoot and support a large range of issues across the Windows virtual machines and physical machines across the entire company. These issues ranged from anything involving Active Directory permissioning issues or app crashings or updates failing to pass through with Windows Update and all other varieties of issues.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a mix of emotions, with notable levels of calmness (0.16), interest (0.13), and contempt (0.11), alongside moderate levels of awkwardness (0.10) and sarcasm (0.11), suggesting a composed yet potentially defensive or dismissive attitude during the interview.",
        "feedback": "The accuracy of the answer provided is 85%.\n\nFeedback:\n1. The candidate mentioned having over 10 years of experience with Microsoft Windows, which is a strong point. However, it would have been beneficial to specify the versions of Windows they are most familiar with, as this can be relevant for the role.\n2. The candidate described troubleshooting a variety of issues, including Active Directory permissioning, app crashes, and Windows Update failures. While these are relevant issues, providing specific examples or scenarios where they successfully resolved these issues would strengthen their response.\n3. The phrase \"app crashings\" could be more clearly stated as \"application crashes\" for better clarity, but this is a minor point and does not detract significantly from the overall response.\n\nOverall, the candidate demonstrated relevant experience and knowledge, but could enhance their answer with more specific examples and clarity."

        "interviewer": "Thank you for sharing that. Could you describe your experience with Active Directory, specifically in areas like security groups, administration, and deployment?",
        "candidate": " Sure, thanks for asking. I've designed and implemented security group structures for organizations, mainly G research. So this involves defining group scopes, so like global, universal, domain, local, and then assigning permissions, hurt resources based on group membership. When it comes to administration, I've been responsible for like day-to-day Active Directory administration. When it came to adding new users, I had to sort of organize the corporate structure inside of Active Directory, so who reports to who, and that entire structural leadership. I've also been involved in deploying Active Directory when we set up a new subnetwork entirely. I was responsible for deploying Active Directory in that network of machines. So I have got a good amount of experience, mainly at G research with Active Directory.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited strong feelings of annoyance (0.77) and disapproval (0.44), accompanied by notable levels of disappointment (0.29), anger (0.17), and distress (0.15), suggesting a highly negative emotional state that could be concerning in an interview setting.",
        "feedback": "The accuracy of the answer provided is 90%.\n\nFeedback:\n1. The candidate effectively described their experience with designing and implementing security group structures, including defining group scopes and assigning permissions based on group membership. This aligns well with the question regarding security groups in Active Directory.\n2. The mention of organizing the corporate structure within Active Directory and handling day-to-day administration tasks is relevant and demonstrates practical experience. However, providing specific examples of challenges faced or how they resolved particular issues would enhance the response.\n3. The candidate stated they were responsible for deploying Active Directory in a new subnetwork, which is a significant point. However, elaborating on the deployment process, such as the tools or methods used, would provide a clearer picture of their expertise.\n4. The phrase \"hurt resources\" appears to be a transcription error and should likely be \"shared resources.\" This does not detract from the candidate's knowledge but should be noted as a transcription issue.\n\nOverall, the candidate demonstrated a solid understanding of Active Directory, particularly in security groups and administration, but could improve their answer with more specific examples and details about their deployment experience."

        "interviewer": "I see. Can you tell me about your experience with Windows Server environments, particularly versions 2012 and 2016? What roles have you played in their design, deployment, maintenance, and support?",
        "candidate": " Sure, the design and deployment of these Windows Server environments was handled by a different team however the maintenance and support was offloaded onto us. So as a maintenance and support engineer for these Windows Server environments, I was responsible for remoting into several Windows servers and troubleshooting issues, updating packages that are needed for the software running on these servers, ensuring that services were properly running on these servers, checking out time and responding to server crash notices that came up on our dashboard as well. These servers that are supported vary between being physical servers or hosted virtual servers on VMware for example, where we have a VMware infrastructure which runs a large amount of these Windows 2012 and 2016 servers.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a high level of satisfaction (0.64) and contentment (0.45), coupled with significant pride (0.39) and calmness (0.26), suggesting a confident and positive demeanor during the interview, while also demonstrating strong concentration (0.10) and interest (0.12), which are favorable traits for a successful interview performance.",
        "feedback": "**Accuracy Percentage:** 80%\n\n**Feedback:**\n1. The candidate mentioned that the design and deployment of the Windows Server environments were handled by a different team, which is relevant but could be seen as a limitation in their direct experience. It would be beneficial for the candidate to clarify their involvement in any aspects of the design process, even if it was minimal.\n   \n2. The candidate described their responsibilities in maintenance and support, including troubleshooting issues, updating packages, and ensuring services were running. While these tasks are relevant, providing specific examples of issues they resolved or challenges they faced would enhance the response.\n\n3. The mention of remoting into several Windows servers and checking server crash notices is good, but the candidate could elaborate on the tools or methods used for these tasks to demonstrate their technical proficiency.\n\n4. The candidate noted that the servers supported varied between physical and virtual servers on VMware. While this is relevant, it would strengthen their answer to include any specific experiences or challenges faced while managing these different types of servers.\n\n5. The phrase \"checking out time\" appears to be a transcription error and should likely be \"checking uptime.\" This does not detract from the candidate's knowledge but should be noted as a transcription issue. \n\nOverall, the candidate demonstrated relevant experience in maintenance and support of Windows Server environments but could improve their answer with more specific examples and details about their involvement in the design and deployment processes."

        "interviewer": "Thank you for that information. Lastly, could you share your experience with networking, particularly in areas like VLAN configuration, routing, and TCP/IP troubleshooting?",
        "candidate": " Yeah, of course. Whenever we would get a GRAD ticket come in for any networking related issues, we would first mainly try troubleshooting and solving it ourselves. So I would use mainly Cisco Packet Tracer because our network was built on Cisco infrastructure. And from there I would be able to identify sort of if the packets that are being sent are reaching their destination properly, if not what the issue was. Sometimes the issue was actually more Windows related where the Windows TCPIP configuration was incorrect. Or sometimes the TCPIP port forwarding was incorrect on some random Windows server. So I do have bits of experience here and there when it comes to networking. And I'm definitely looking forward to learning more. But I do believe I have enough for the role.",

However, providing more detail on the types of issues encountered, particularly related to VLAN configuration and routing, would enhance their answer.\n\n3. The mention of Windows-related issues, such as incorrect TCP/IP configuration and port forwarding, is relevant but could be more focused on networking aspects. The candidate could improve their response by discussing how they specifically addressed these issues in the context of networking.\n\n4. The candidate expressed a desire to learn more about networking, which is positive. However, they could have highlighted any specific areas of networking they are particularly interested in or any steps they are taking to further their knowledge, which would demonstrate initiative and commitment to professional growth.\n\nOverall, the candidate demonstrated a foundational understanding of networking concepts and troubleshooting but could enhance their answer with more specific examples and a deeper focus on networking-related experiences."
