        "interviewer": "Hello! Thank you for taking the time to speak with me today about the Entry Level RAG Engineer position. To start, could you tell me about your experience with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and any projects you've worked on that involved this technology?",
        "candidate": " yes I worked on building a rag pipeline and the LLM model of choice was llama that is L L A M A 3.1 by Meta and I used the 8 billion parameter model because it was the only thing that I could run locally and I used lang chain to create a rag pipeline where I would load the context the LLM context with the latest information by web scraping",
        "sentiment": null,
        "feedback": "The accuracy of the answer provided is 80%.\n\n**Inaccuracies and Feedback:**\n\n1. **Detail on RAG Pipeline**: The candidate mentions building a RAG pipeline but does not provide specific details about the architecture or components of the pipeline. Including more information about how the pipeline was structured or the specific steps taken would enhance the response.\n\n2. **Model Choice Justification**: While the candidate states they used the 8 billion parameter model of LLaMA due to local running constraints, it would be beneficial to explain why this model was chosen over others in terms of performance or suitability for the project.\n\n3. **Web Scraping Context**: The candidate mentions using web scraping to load context for the LLM but does not elaborate on the types of data scraped or how it was integrated into the RAG pipeline. Providing examples of the data sources or the relevance of the scraped data to the tasks would strengthen the answer.\n\n4. **Technical Clarity**: The answer could benefit from clearer technical language. For instance, the phrase \"load the context the LLM context\" is somewhat redundant and could be rephrased for clarity.\n\nOverall, the candidate demonstrates relevant experience with RAG and LLMs, but additional details and clarity would improve the quality of the response."
