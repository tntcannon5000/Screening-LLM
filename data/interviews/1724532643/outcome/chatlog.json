        "interviewer": "Hello! Thank you for taking the time to speak with me today about the Entry-Level Morning Receptionist position at our research institute. I'd like to ask you a few questions to learn more about your qualifications and interest in the role. Could you start by telling me what attracted you to this position?",
        "candidate": " Yes, so I needed to make some quick money and I also have some experience as a receptionist working at the University of Kent. I guess the combination of those two.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a notable level of calmness (0.32) and interest (0.22), along with moderate levels of positive surprise (0.16), boredom (0.11), and enthusiasm (0.09), suggesting an engaged yet somewhat detached demeanor, while the overall sentiment leaned slightly positive (highest values in 5-6 range) and toxicity levels remained negligible, indicating a generally appropriate and professional response.",
        "feedback": "The accuracy of the answer provided is 60%.\n\nFeedback:\n1. The candidate mentioned needing to make \"some quick money\" as a primary motivation for applying to the position. While financial considerations are valid, this response may come across as less enthusiastic or committed to the role itself. It would be beneficial for the candidate to express a genuine interest in the responsibilities and opportunities associated with the receptionist position, rather than focusing primarily on the financial aspect.\n   \n2. The candidate referenced their experience as a receptionist at the University of Kent, which is relevant. However, they did not elaborate on what specific skills or experiences from that role would make them a good fit for the Entry-Level Morning Receptionist position at the research institute. Providing more detail about their relevant skills or experiences would strengthen their response. \n\nOverall, while the candidate provided some relevant information, the answer could be improved by emphasizing a stronger interest in the role and elaborating on their qualifications."

        "interviewer": "I see. Thank you for sharing that. Could you tell me more about your experience as a receptionist at the University of Kent? What were some of your main responsibilities in that role?",
        "candidate": " I guess some of the main responsibilities was listening to clients complain and sorting out their complaints Making keychains not keychains fobs for guests To lead them to the specific room to help For them to have access to the specific kitchen and always and you know, hmm nothing else",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a high level of contemplation and interest, with notable levels of confusion and awkwardness, suggesting they were deeply engaged in thought but perhaps struggling to articulate their ideas clearly or confidently during the interview.",
        "feedback": "The accuracy of the answer provided is 40%.\n\nFeedback:\n1. The candidate mentioned \"listening to clients complain and sorting out their complaints,\" which is relevant to the role of a receptionist. However, the phrasing is vague and lacks specificity. It would be more effective to describe how they handled complaints, such as providing solutions or following up with clients, which demonstrates problem-solving skills.\n\n2. The mention of \"making keychains not keychains fobs for guests\" is unclear and seems to be a transcription error. If the candidate meant to refer to creating key fobs for guests, it should be stated more clearly. This part of the answer does not effectively convey a responsibility that would be relevant to the receptionist role.\n\n3. The statement \"To lead them to the specific room to help\" is incomplete and lacks context. It would be beneficial to elaborate on how guiding guests contributes to their overall experience and the importance of customer service in that role.\n\n4. The phrase \"for them to have access to the specific kitchen\" is also vague and does not clearly explain the responsibility. It would be more effective to describe the process of ensuring guests have the necessary access and how that relates to their overall experience.\n\nOverall, the answer lacks clarity and detail, which diminishes its effectiveness in conveying the candidate's experience and responsibilities in the receptionist role. More specific examples and clearer language would improve the response significantly."

        "interviewer": "Thank you for sharing those details. Can you describe a situation where you had to handle a difficult customer or resolve a complex issue while working at the reception desk?",
        "candidate": " Yeah, a customer came complaining that there was someone else in their room because it was double booked and they were screaming and so I didn't do the booking and yeah, I had to face the consequences, but you know I made them understand that it wasn't my fault and they should raise the complaint somewhere else.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited strong feelings of annoyance (0.70) and contempt (0.37), along with notable levels of disapproval (0.36) and sarcasm (0.33), suggesting a highly negative and critical attitude that would likely be inappropriate in most interview settings.",
        "feedback": "**Accuracy Score: 30%**\n\n**Feedback:**\n\n1. The candidate's response lacks professionalism and does not demonstrate effective customer service skills. Instead of taking responsibility for the situation and offering a solution, the candidate deflected blame by stating, \"it wasn't my fault\" and suggested the customer should raise the complaint elsewhere. This approach is not aligned with best practices for handling customer complaints, which emphasize empathy, ownership, and proactive problem-solving.\n\n2. The candidate mentioned that the customer was \"screaming,\" but did not elaborate on how they managed the situation or calmed the customer down. Effective receptionists should be able to de-escalate tense situations and provide reassurance to upset customers. Including specific actions taken to address the customer's concerns would have strengthened the response.\n\n3. The answer lacks detail about the steps taken to resolve the issue. For example, the candidate could have mentioned if they contacted management, offered an alternative room, or provided any form of compensation. This would demonstrate their ability to handle complex issues effectively.\n\n4. The overall tone of the response comes across as dismissive and unprofessional. A more suitable response would include an acknowledgment of the customer's feelings and a commitment to resolving the issue, which is crucial in customer service roles.\n\nOverall, the candidate's answer does not reflect the necessary skills and attitudes required for handling difficult customer situations effectively. More emphasis on empathy, problem-solving, and professionalism would improve the response significantly."

        "interviewer": "I see. Thank you for sharing that experience. Our receptionist role requires excellent communication skills and the ability to multitask. Can you give an example of how you've managed multiple tasks or priorities simultaneously in a professional setting?",
        "candidate": " Yes, so during my work at reception I do generally get a lot of free time when there are no guests that are coming in. So in this instance I do work on a lot of personal stuff such as writing my dissertation. So in one such instance if a guest comes in I have to prioritize booking the room or creating a for-for the guest and not do my work. So that would be one instance when I multitask or prioritize something more valuable.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited strong feelings of annoyance and anger, coupled with significant distress and anxiety, suggesting they were struggling to maintain composure during a challenging or frustrating part of the interview, which could be concerning for their ability to handle stress in a professional setting.",
        "feedback": "**Accuracy Score: 40%**\n\n**Feedback:**\n\n1. The candidate mentions having \"a lot of free time\" at the reception, which may not accurately reflect the typical responsibilities of a receptionist. This could imply a lack of understanding of the role's demands, as receptionists are often expected to be busy with various tasks, even when there are no guests present. It would be more effective to describe how they utilized downtime productively, such as organizing files or preparing for upcoming tasks.\n\n2. The candidate states that they prioritize \"booking the room or creating a for-for the guest,\" which seems to be a transcription error. If they meant to say \"creating a folder for the guest,\" this should be clarified. However, the focus on prioritizing these tasks is relevant, but the explanation lacks depth. It would be beneficial to provide a more detailed example of how they managed competing priorities, perhaps by describing a specific situation where they had to balance multiple tasks effectively.\n\n3. The response does not provide a clear example of multitasking or prioritization in a high-pressure situation. Instead, it focuses on a scenario where the candidate had to choose between personal work and guest service. A stronger answer would include a specific instance where they successfully managed multiple tasks simultaneously, demonstrating their ability to handle the demands of the receptionist role.\n\n4. The overall tone of the response could be perceived as somewhat casual and lacking professionalism. A more structured and formal approach would enhance the impression of the candidate's communication skills, which are crucial for a receptionist position. \n\nOverall, while the candidate attempts to address the question, the response lacks clarity, depth, and professionalism, which diminishes its effectiveness in showcasing their multitasking abilities."

        "interviewer": "Thank you for your time. We'll be in touch regarding next steps in the hiring process.",
        "candidate": "Thank you, goodbye",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited strong feelings of annoyance (0.44), contempt (0.28), and disapproval (0.34), along with a notable degree of sarcasm (0.38) and confusion (0.14), suggesting a negative and potentially defensive attitude towards the question or topic being discussed in the interview.",
        "feedback": "**Accuracy Score: 20%**\n\n**Feedback:**\n\n1. The response \"Thank you, goodbye\" is overly simplistic and does not adequately acknowledge the previous statement about the hiring process. A more appropriate response would include a note of appreciation for the opportunity and a positive closing remark, which would reflect better communication skills and professionalism.\n\n2. The phrase \"Thank you\" is appropriate, but it lacks elaboration. A more effective response could express gratitude for the interview and excitement about the potential next steps in the hiring process. This would demonstrate enthusiasm for the position and engagement with the interviewer.\n\n3. The use of \"goodbye\" is quite abrupt and informal for a professional context. A more suitable closing could include phrases like \"I look forward to hearing from you\" or \"I appreciate your time and consideration,\" which would convey a more professional tone.\n\nOverall, the response does not meet the expectations for a professional closing in a hiring context, lacking depth and warmth that would be appropriate in such a situation."
