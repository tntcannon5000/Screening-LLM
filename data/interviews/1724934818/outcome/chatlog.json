        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a high level of interest (0.51) and excitement (0.33), along with notable levels of awkwardness (0.16) and determination (0.14), suggesting they were engaged and fully able to verbalise their thoughts.",

        "interviewer": "That's great to hear. Let's begin our discussion about the Entry Level Receptionist role. Could you tell me about any previous experience you have in customer service or hospitality?",
        "candidate": " Yes, sure. I'm working at the University of Kent as a part-time receptionist while I'm completing my masters and previous to this I was also employed in customer facing roles in IT companies. I worked for two years as a support engineer liaising with clients and solving high problem issues that arose when their software was not running.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited strong positive emotions, particularly contentment (0.579), satisfaction (0.573), and gratitude (0.534), along with a calm demeanor (0.277) and moderate joy (0.201), indicating a highly favorable and appreciative attitude during this part of the interview, which would likely be viewed positively by potential employers.",
        "feedback": "The accuracy of the answer \"Yes, sure.

I worked for two years as a support engineer liaising with clients and solving high problem issues that arose when their software was not running.\" in response to the question \"Could you tell me about any previous experience you have in customer service or hospitality?\" is 85%.\n\nFeedback:\n1. The candidate mentions their current role as a part-time receptionist at the University of Kent, which is relevant to the position being discussed. However, they do not elaborate on specific customer service skills or experiences gained in this role, which would strengthen their response.\n2. The mention of previous experience in IT companies as a support engineer is relevant, but it may not directly align with the hospitality context of the receptionist role. While technical support roles do involve customer interaction, the candidate could have emphasized more on how this experience translates to customer service in a hospitality setting.\n3. The phrase \"solving high problem issues\" could be more clearly articulated. A more straightforward expression would enhance clarity and professionalism in the response. \n\nOverall, while the candidate provides relevant experience, they could improve their answer by focusing more on customer service aspects and how their skills apply to the hospitality industry."

        "interviewer": "Thank you for sharing that information. Your experience as a part-time receptionist at the University of Kent is certainly relevant. Could you describe some of your key responsibilities in that role?",
        "candidate": " Sure, some of my key responsibilities include welcoming guests, preparing fobs for the guests so that they have access to their particular corridors, kitchens and rooms. Also, I am in charge of booking guests who have not booked through the web portal and directly come to the reception to get a room. Also, I am in charge of coordinating between guests and housekeeping staff and the estate staff should any problems arise for the particular guests such as broken windows, heaters not working or bed sheets not done in the day to name a few.",

The candidate provides a clear and detailed description of their responsibilities, which is relevant to the role of a receptionist. They mention welcoming guests, preparing access fobs, and handling bookings, which are all pertinent tasks for a receptionist position.\n2. The mention of coordinating with housekeeping and estate staff to resolve issues for guests is a strong point, as it demonstrates the candidate's ability to manage guest relations and problem-solving.\n3. However, the phrase \"bed sheets not done in the day\" could be more clearly articulated. A more straightforward expression, such as \"if bed sheets were not changed during the day,\" would enhance clarity and professionalism in the response.\n4. The answer could benefit from a more structured format, perhaps by listing responsibilities in a more organized manner, which would improve readability.\n\nOverall, the candidate effectively conveys their responsibilities, but minor adjustments in clarity and structure could enhance the response."

        "interviewer": "I see. Thank you for that overview. In this role at Hilton, you'd be working with a diverse range of guests. How do you handle difficult or upset customers?",
        "candidate": " Yes, so I handle upset customers. When any issues arise as a receptionist, you have to take the responsibility on yourself. On such incident, I can call back from memory is when a guest showed up to reception because their room was double booked. We had to calm the guest down. By we, I mean I had to calm the guest down and be apologetic to the guest since this happened because double bookings weren't the fault of the booking agent but a fault in the software itself. I had to explain to the guest the best I can about the situation and then I had to book a separate room for the guest for the remainder of their stay. Thank you.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited strong signs of enthusiasm (0.63) and desire (0.21), coupled with moderate levels of admiration (0.28), determination (0.19), and tiredness (0.12), suggesting an energetic demeanour which is crucial to interacting with guests, despite showing some amount of tiredness.",

Thank you.\" in response to the question \"How do you handle difficult or upset customers?\" is 80%.\n\nFeedback:\n1. The candidate demonstrates an understanding of the importance of taking responsibility when handling upset customers, which is a key aspect of customer service.\n2. The example provided about dealing with a double-booked room is relevant and illustrates the candidate's experience in a real-life situation. However, the explanation could be more concise and focused on the steps taken to resolve the issue rather than the technical details of the booking system.\n3. The phrase \"we had to calm the guest down\" could be misleading as it implies a team effort, while the candidate later clarifies that they were the one who handled the situation. It would be clearer to state that they personally took charge of calming the guest.\n4. The candidate could enhance their response by including specific techniques used to calm the guest, such as offering an apology, showing empathy, or providing a solution, which are all effective strategies for handling difficult customers.\n5. The closing statement \"Thank you\" is polite but could be omitted in a response to a question, as it may disrupt the flow of the answer.\n\nOverall, while the candidate provides a relevant example and demonstrates an understanding of customer service principles, the response could be improved by focusing more on specific actions taken and techniques used to handle the upset customer."

        "interviewer": "Thank you for sharing that experience. One last question: The Hilton receptionist role requires knowledge of hotel facilities and room categories. How would you go about familiarizing yourself with these aspects if you were to join our team?",
        "candidate": " I would ask the people already present and staff about the layout of the hotel and I would myself visit each and every corridor of the most important parts of the hotel to get familiarized with the layout so that I can interact with the guests accordingly and some of the hidden parts or corridors throughout the hotel I will get acclimatized I will get used to them as and when I receive complaints on the job so basically get familiarized with the main layout and then if any niche scenarios arise I will get familiarized with them on the job.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a high level of satisfaction (0.66) and calm (0.34), along with notable levels of content (0.28) and strong interest (0.12), suggesting a positive emotional state that could be perceived as favourable in an interview setting.",
        "feedback": "The accuracy of the answer \"I would ask the people already present and staff about the layout of the hotel and I would myself visit each and every corridor of the most important parts of the hotel to get familiarized with the layout so that I can interact with the guests accordingly and some of the hidden parts or corridors throughout the hotel I will get acclimatized I will get used to them as and when I receive complaints on the job so basically get familiarized with the main layout and then if any niche scenarios arise I will get familiarized with them on the job.\" in response to the question \"How would you go about familiarizing yourself with these aspects if you were to join our team?\" is 75%.\n\nFeedback:\n1. The candidate mentions asking existing staff about the layout of the hotel, which is a good approach to gather information. However, they could have elaborated on how they would ensure they receive comprehensive and accurate information from staff, such as by asking specific questions or seeking guidance from a mentor.\n2. The candidate states they would visit \"each and every corridor of the most important parts of the hotel,\" which is a positive initiative. However, the phrasing could be more concise. Instead of \"each and every corridor,\" they could simply say \"all key areas of the hotel.\"\n3. The mention of getting acclimatized to \"hidden parts or corridors\" is relevant, but the explanation could be clearer. The candidate could have specified that they would explore these areas proactively rather than waiting for complaints to arise.\n4. The response lacks a structured approach. The candidate could have organized their thoughts into clear steps, such as: 1) asking staff for information, 2) exploring key areas, and 3) learning about specific scenarios as they arise. This would enhance clarity and professionalism in their response.\n5. The phrase \"if any niche scenarios arise\" is vague and could be better articulated. The candidate could specify that they would learn about unique situations or challenges as they encounter them, which would demonstrate adaptability.\n\nOverall, while the candidate provides a reasonable plan for familiarizing themselves with hotel facilities and room categories, the response could benefit from more clarity, structure, and specificity."
