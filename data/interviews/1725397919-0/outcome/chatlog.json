        "interviewer": "Hello! Thank you for taking the time to speak with me today about the Entry Level RAG Engineer position. I'd like to ask you a few questions to learn more about your experience and skills. Could you tell me about your experience with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines?",
        "candidate": " Yes, sure. I have some experience in retrieval of augmented generation pipelines. Mainly I used RAG to do my final thesis project, which is an automated screening system. I used RAG for the verification process to put up-to-date information from the internet in the context of an LLM so that it can verify all the information that is available currently.",
        "feedback": "**Accuracy Score: 75%**\n\n**Feedback:**\n\n1. The candidate mentions using RAG for their final thesis project, which is a relevant experience. However, the description of the project as an \"automated screening system\" lacks detail. It would be beneficial to elaborate on how RAG specifically contributed to the verification process and what kind of data was retrieved and generated.\n\n2. The candidate states that RAG was used to \"put up-to-date information from the internet in the context of an LLM.\" While this aligns with the purpose of RAG systems, the explanation could be clearer. It would be helpful to specify how the retrieval step was implemented and how the LLM utilized the retrieved information to enhance the verification process.\n\n3. The answer could benefit from mentioning specific techniques or tools used in the RAG pipeline, such as the type of retrieval mechanism or the LLM employed. This would provide a clearer picture of the candidate's hands-on experience and technical skills related to RAG systems.\n\nOverall, while the candidate demonstrates some understanding of RAG and its application, providing more specific details about their experience and the technical aspects of the project would enhance the response."

        "interviewer": "That's interesting. Can you elaborate on the specific challenges you faced while implementing RAG in your thesis project, and how you overcame them?",
        "candidate": " Sure, so breaking down a candidate's answer into queries wasn't my first approach. I couldn't find a way to break down the answer or like provide a search query for getting information on the relevant topics and then through query decomposition I got relevant answers like by breaking down the string into sub queries and then searching for it. That expanded the search space so that is how I solved it.",
        "feedback": "**Accuracy Score: 70%**\n\n**Feedback:**\n\n1. The candidate mentions that breaking down a candidate's answer into queries wasn't their first approach, which indicates a lack of initial strategy. However, they do not elaborate on what their initial approach was or why it was ineffective. Providing this context would enhance the understanding of the challenges faced.\n\n2. The candidate describes using query decomposition to expand the search space, which is relevant. However, they do not specify how they implemented this process or what specific techniques or tools were used. Mentioning these details would provide a clearer picture of their problem-solving approach.\n\n3. The answer lacks clarity regarding the specific challenges encountered during the implementation of RAG. While the candidate mentions overcoming difficulties with query decomposition, they do not detail what those challenges were or how they specifically addressed them. More explicit examples of the challenges and solutions would strengthen the response.\n\n4. The candidate's explanation of breaking down the string into sub-queries is somewhat vague. It would be beneficial to clarify what kind of strings they were working with and how the sub-queries were formulated. This would help in understanding the complexity of the task and the candidate's thought process.\n\nOverall, while the candidate demonstrates some understanding of the RAG implementation process, providing more specific details about the challenges faced and the strategies used to overcome them would enhance the response."

    {
        "interviewer": "Thank you for sharing that. Moving on, can you describe your experience with different large language models (LLMs) and how you've compared their performance for specific tasks?",
        "candidate": " I'm sure I've worked with JadGPT, Claude, Sonnet and Lama. I would rank them as Claude Sonnet is the highest for reasoning, JadGPT comes in second and Lama comes in third.",
        "feedback": "**Accuracy Score: 60%**\n\n**Feedback:**\n\n1. The candidate mentions \"JadGPT,\" which appears to be a transcription error for \"ChatGPT.\" This should be corrected, but it does not affect the overall understanding of their experience with LLMs.\n\n2. The ranking provided by the candidate lacks clarity and justification. While they rank Claude Sonnet as the highest for reasoning, they do not explain why they believe this to be the case. Providing specific examples or metrics from their experience would strengthen their argument and demonstrate a deeper understanding of the models' capabilities.\n\n3. The candidate states that \"JadGPT comes in second and Lama comes in third.\" However, they do not provide any context or criteria for this ranking. It would be beneficial to elaborate on the specific tasks or benchmarks used for comparison, as well as any personal experiences that influenced their rankings.\n\n4. The mention of \"Lama\" likely refers to \"LLaMA,\" which is another transcription error. This should be corrected, but again, it does not detract from the candidate's overall experience.\n\n5. The answer lacks detail regarding the specific tasks for which the models were compared. Mentioning particular applications or scenarios where they evaluated the performance of these models would provide a clearer picture of their experience and insights.\n\nOverall, while the candidate demonstrates familiarity with several LLMs, the lack of detailed justification for their rankings and the absence of specific examples or metrics significantly reduce the effectiveness of their response."
