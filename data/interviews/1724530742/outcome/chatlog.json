        "interviewer": "Hello! Thank you for taking the time to speak with me today about the Entry-Level Morning Receptionist (Part Time) position at our research institute. I'd like to ask you a few questions to learn more about your qualifications and interest in this role. Could you start by telling me why you're interested in this position?",
        "candidate": " Yes, sure. So I've been working as a part-time receptionist at the University of Kent for a year right now. And I think I'd be qualified in a customer-facing role such as this. Previous to this, I've also worked as a support engineer in big tech companies such as Ingram Micro and TCS, where I had to face customer queries from clients regarding whether the software is working or not. And I'll be graduating the University of Kent in two months, and after that I'm looking for a job in Cambridge, and this happens to be the perfect thing lined up for me.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a notable level of anger (0.32) and annoyance (0.22), along with moderate levels of positive anxiety (0.16) and awkwardness (0.11).",
        "feedback": "The accuracy score for the answer provided is 85%.\n\nFeedback on inaccuracies:\n\n1. **Relevance of Experience**: While the candidate mentions their experience as a part-time receptionist, they could have elaborated more on specific skills or tasks that directly relate to the responsibilities of the Entry-Level Morning Receptionist position. For example, discussing specific customer service skills or experiences that would be beneficial in a receptionist role would strengthen their response.\n\n2. **Connection to the Role**: The candidate states that the position is \"the perfect thing lined up for me,\" but does not elaborate on why this specific role at the research institute appeals to them beyond location. Providing more insight into their interest in the research institute or how it aligns with their career goals would enhance their answer.\n\n3. **Future Aspirations**: The mention of looking for a job in Cambridge is relevant, but it could be more effective if tied back to how this position fits into their long-term career plans or aspirations, particularly in relation to the research field.\n\nOverall, the candidate has relevant experience but could improve their answer by making stronger connections between their background and the specific role they are applying for."

        "interviewer": "Thank you for sharing that background. It's great to hear about your relevant experience. Could you tell me more about your availability? This position requires opening reception at 8:30 AM and working until 12:45 PM, Monday to Friday. Would you be able to commit to these hours?",
        "candidate": " Yes, sure. After I graduate from university, I will have permission to work 40 hours a week. And apart from that, I am very punctual. Currently, my working hours are from 9 a.m. to 2 a.m. 2 p.m. My bad. And previously, when I worked as a tech support engineer, my working hours were from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Sometimes it extended from 9 a.m. to 10 p.m. depending on heavy workloads. And I was able to deliver to those times. And I think I will be able to deliver for the part-time receptionist role at Cambridge.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited strong boredom (0.62) and confusion (0.60), coupled with high levels of contempt (0.19) and disappointment (0.20), while also displaying notable disapproval (0.32) and excitement (0.30).",
        "feedback": "**Accuracy Score**: 75%\n\n**Feedback on Inaccuracies**:\n\n1. **Availability Clarity**: The candidate does not explicitly confirm their ability to commit to the required hours of 8:30 AM to 12:45 PM, Monday to Friday. While they mention having permission to work 40 hours a week after graduation, they should directly address the specific hours needed for this position to provide a clearer response.\n\n2. **Current Working Hours Confusion**: The candidate states their current working hours as \"from 9 a.m. to 2 a.m. 2 p.m.\" This appears to be a transcription error, but it creates confusion regarding their actual availability. They should clarify their current working hours to avoid misunderstandings.\n\n3. **Relevance of Past Experience**: While the candidate mentions their previous roles, they do not connect their past experiences directly to the responsibilities of the receptionist position. They could enhance their answer by discussing how their punctuality and experience in customer-facing roles would specifically benefit them in this part-time receptionist role.\n\n4. **Commitment to the Role**: The candidate states, \"I think I will be able to deliver for the part-time receptionist role at Cambridge,\" which lacks confidence. A more assertive statement about their commitment to the role would strengthen their response. \n\nOverall, the candidate has relevant experience but needs to provide clearer and more direct answers regarding their availability and how their background aligns with the specific requirements of the position."

        "interviewer": "I see, thank you for that information. This role requires excellent communication and interpersonal skills. Can you give me an example of how you've demonstrated these skills in your previous receptionist or customer service roles?",
        "candidate": " I'm sure. I think the most important customer service or speaking skills come into focus when the customer is agitated. So one such example would be double booking the same room for two different customers. This happened one time when I was at reception even though I was not responsible for that particular booking. So the customer was very angry at the situation and when they approached reception they wanted to get answers. However, I had to take the responsibility on myself and had to have a very apologetic tone when dealing with the customer and to kind of show them that this was an error with the booking system itself not with the reception. And eventually they understood and we were able to book a new room for them. And one such situation from my time as a support engineer would be when I initially joined the role I did not know the layouts of the entire application or the pitfalls of the application I was working on and I had a really high or tense call with a customer since their transactions were not processed at a specific date. I had to get help from my senior support staff and also convince them of the technical difficulties why they could not do and there was nothing that could be done at the moment and if they allowed us two days of time we would enable the transaction and that this would not happen in the future. And the customer was convinced and they continued to use our software from there on. So these are the two circumstances that come into mind when dealing with customers in a very efficient and responsible and apologetic way to cool them down.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited high levels of calmness (0.38), contentment (0.26), and disgust (0.30), coupled with strong doubt (0.20) and sarcasm (0.24), while also displaying tiredness (0.36) and satisfaction (0.10).",
        "feedback": "**Accuracy Score**: 80%\n\n**Feedback on Inaccuracies**:\n\n1. **Responsibility and Ownership**: While the candidate describes taking responsibility for the double booking situation, they could have emphasized their proactive approach in resolving the issue more clearly. Highlighting specific actions taken to de-escalate the situation would strengthen their example.\n\n2. **Clarity in Communication**: The candidate mentions using an \"apologetic tone\" but does not elaborate on how they communicated effectively beyond that. Providing more detail on the specific phrases or techniques used to calm the customer would enhance the response.\n\n3. **Connection to Role Requirements**: The candidate provides two examples, but the second example from their time as a support engineer could be more directly tied to the receptionist role. They should clarify how the skills demonstrated in that situation are relevant to the communication and interpersonal skills required for the receptionist position.\n\n4. **Length and Focus**: The answer is somewhat lengthy and could benefit from being more concise. Streamlining the examples to focus on the most relevant aspects would make the response clearer and more impactful. \n\nOverall, the candidate demonstrates relevant experience but could improve their answer by providing clearer connections to the specific skills required for the receptionist role and enhancing the clarity of their communication."

        "interviewer": "Thank you for sharing those examples. One last question: this role requires proficiency with computer systems. Could you briefly describe your experience with various software or systems you've used in your previous roles?",
        "candidate": " I'm sure. I worked as a support engineer in Big Tech for one year. I also worked as a software developer for the last four years of my professional career. So I'm well-honed in programming skills such as Python, Java, using frameworks such as Django and Spring. I'm also well-honed in using Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, and in my current receptionist role, we use a software called Kinetics to book specific rooms and also configure fobs so that the customer has access to their room, hallway, and kitchen, and only their specific room, hallway, and kitchen and not to others. So I would say I'm pretty well-equipped to deal with computer programs.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a high level of contemplation (0.428) and guilt (0.308), coupled with notable levels of negative surprise (0.247), pain (0.230), and realization (0.209), suggesting a thoughtful and engaged approach to the interview question while maintaining a composed and positive demeanor.",
        "feedback": "**Accuracy Score**: 80%\n\n**Feedback on Inaccuracies**:\n\n1. **Relevance of Experience**: While the candidate mentions their experience as a support engineer and software developer, they could have provided more specific examples of how these roles required proficiency with computer systems. For instance, detailing any specific software or systems they used in those roles would strengthen their response.\n\n2. **Detail on Software Proficiency**: The candidate lists programming languages and frameworks, but they do not elaborate on how these skills are relevant to the receptionist role. It would be beneficial to connect their technical skills to the requirements of the position, particularly in terms of using software for booking and customer management.\n\n3. **Current Role Software Usage**: The candidate mentions using Kinetics software in their current receptionist role, but they could provide more detail about their proficiency with it. For example, explaining specific tasks they perform with Kinetics or any challenges they overcame while using it would enhance their answer.\n\n4. **Generalization of Skills**: The statement \"I'm pretty well-equipped to deal with computer programs\" is somewhat vague. The candidate could improve their response by providing concrete examples of how they have successfully used various computer systems in their previous roles, demonstrating their proficiency more effectively."
