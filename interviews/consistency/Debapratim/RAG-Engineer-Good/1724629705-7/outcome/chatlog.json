        "interviewer": "Hello! Thank you for taking the time to speak with me today about the Entry-Level RAG AI Engineer role. I'd like to start by asking you a few questions about your experience and skills. Could you tell me about any projects you've worked on involving retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines?",
        "candidate": " I'm sure so I'm studying artificial intelligence at the University of Kent currently and for my final dissertation. I'm working on making a automated screening Interview agent and to implement this I have used a rag pipeline mainly as the accuracy verifier so what happens is when the Candidate answers their questions it goes through two pipelines one is the sentiment analysis and one is the accuracy verifier For the accuracy verifier I have implemented a retrieval augmented generation, which would basically break down the answer into separate Searchable strings which will then be searched on Google and The first two articles it will retrieve the contents of the first two articles and input that in the context of the LLM So the LM has more up-to-date information to verify with the whether the answer from the candidate is accurate or not and to give an accuracy percentage",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a high level of interest (0.51) and confusion (0.33), along with notable levels of awkwardness (0.16) and doubt (0.14), suggesting they were engaged but struggling to fully comprehend or articulate their thoughts, which could be interpreted as a mix of enthusiasm and uncertainty in an interview setting.",
        "feedback": "**Accuracy Percentage:** 85%\n\n**Feedback:**\n\n1. The candidate mentioned they are studying artificial intelligence at the University of Kent and are working on an automated screening interview agent for their dissertation. This is relevant and shows their engagement with AI projects.\n\n2. The explanation of the RAG pipeline is mostly accurate, but there are some areas that could be clarified. The candidate states that the RAG pipeline is used as an \"accuracy verifier.\" While RAG can enhance the accuracy of responses by providing up-to-date information, it is not typically referred to as an \"accuracy verifier.\" This could lead to some confusion about the role of RAG in the pipeline.\n\n3. The candidate describes breaking down the candidate's answers into \"searchable strings\" and searching Google for articles. This is a practical application of RAG, but it would be beneficial to mention how the retrieved articles are processed and integrated into the LLM's context. The explanation could be clearer regarding how the information from the articles is utilized to assess the accuracy of the candidate's responses.\n\n4. The candidate mentions providing an \"accuracy percentage\" based on the comparison of the candidate's answers with the retrieved information. While this is a valid approach, it would be helpful to elaborate on how this percentage is calculated and what criteria are used to determine accuracy.\n\nOverall, the candidate demonstrates a solid understanding of RAG pipelines and their application in their project, but some clarifications and elaborations would enhance the explanation."

    {
        "interviewer": "That's an interesting project. Can you elaborate on the specific challenges you faced while implementing the RAG pipeline for your accuracy verifier? How did you address issues like retrieval quality or context relevance?",
        "candidate": " Yes, so to improve the context or the retrieval quality of the rag pipeline, I had to break down the answer from the candidate into searchable strings with the help of an LLM. So let's say an answer can be broken down into six query strings. Each of these six query strings would then be used to search in Google and we would draw the context from the first two web pages. So in a total we would get the information from a total of 12 web pages for one answer. So this I think is plenty of information to feed the LLM. This answer, this document would then be stored in a vector store and when the LLM would be queried on a specific topic or like when the LLM wanted to verify the accuracy of a certain answer it would then use a cosine similarity to find out the relevant portions of the vector store that are relevant to the answer. And doing this, it would vastly improve the quality of the answers fetched. I got this from a paper written by Google called Query Decomposition. This was the technique they used and this overcame the shortcomings of just searching for two or three websites instead of getting a more holistic picture of the entire topics being discussed in the answer.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a high level of concentration (0.84) and contemplation (0.36), coupled with moderate levels of determination (0.25), interest (0.29), and satisfaction (0.23), suggesting they were deeply engaged in providing a thoughtful and focused answer while maintaining a generally positive demeanor during the interview.",
        "feedback": "**Accuracy Percentage:** 90%\n\n**Feedback:**\n\n1. The candidate effectively describes the process of breaking down answers into searchable strings and using Google to retrieve relevant articles. This approach demonstrates a practical understanding of enhancing retrieval quality in a RAG pipeline.\n\n2. The explanation of using cosine similarity to find relevant portions of the vector store is accurate and aligns with common practices in RAG implementations. This method is a valid approach to improve context relevance.\n\n3. The candidate mentions drawing context from the first two web pages retrieved, which is a reasonable strategy. However, it would be beneficial to clarify how the information from these pages is processed and integrated into the LLM's context for accuracy verification.\n\n4. The reference to the Google paper on Query Decomposition is a strong point, as it shows the candidate's engagement with existing literature and techniques in the field. However, it would enhance the answer to briefly explain how this technique specifically addresses the challenges faced in their implementation.\n\nOverall, the candidate demonstrates a solid understanding of the RAG pipeline and the challenges associated with retrieval quality and context relevance. A few clarifications regarding the integration of retrieved information and the specific application of techniques would further strengthen the response."

        "interviewer": "That's a sophisticated approach. How did you handle the integration of this RAG pipeline with the large language model? Were there any specific challenges in terms of prompt engineering or model selection?",
        "candidate": " For model selection, we chose JATGBD 4.0 mini mainly because we used Langchain to implement the rank pipeline and GPT 4.0 mini had the perfect balance of intelligence and cost effectiveness and also speed that we had to manage. And this was just to verify the answer. So we did not go for a more sophisticated model such as Claude SONET 3.5 which is considered the most intelligent LLM till now. We did not need such a high powered LLM, we just needed a cost effective LLM to just verify the answer and make searchable strings and JATGBD 4.0 mini was perfect for the job. Apart from this, for prompt engineering, yes, I had to write several prompts to give the last rank pipeline to verify the answer. So what would happen is when we converted speech to text from the interview, some of the text had grammatical errors or typographical errors which is common for most text translation apps. So to overcome this, I had to prompt the LLM to specifically overlook grammatical errors or to make sense of words that were not properly converted but were close to the actual word that the candidate was trying to explain. So these were some of the challenges that I faced.",
        "sentiment": null,
        "feedback": "**Accuracy Percentage:** 80%\n\n**Feedback:**\n\n1. The candidate mentions selecting \"JATGBD 4.0 mini\" for model selection, which appears to be a typographical error or miscommunication. The correct model name is likely \"GPT-4o\" or \"GPT-4 mini.\" This should be clarified, as it may lead to confusion regarding the model's capabilities and comparisons with other models like Claude 3.5 Sonnet.\n\n2. The candidate states that they chose GPT-4o mini for its \"balance of intelligence and cost-effectiveness.\" While this is a valid point, it would be beneficial to provide more context on how this balance was determined, especially in comparison to Claude 3.5 Sonnet, which is mentioned as a more sophisticated model. The candidate could elaborate on specific criteria used for this selection.\n\n3. The explanation regarding prompt engineering is generally clear, but the candidate could enhance their response by providing specific examples of the prompts used to address grammatical and typographical errors. This would give a better understanding of the practical challenges faced and the strategies employed to overcome them.\n\n4. The candidate mentions that they had to prompt the LLM to overlook grammatical errors. While this is a valid approach, it would be helpful to explain how this was implemented in practice and whether it affected the overall accuracy of the responses generated by the LLM.\n\n5. The candidate's mention of the challenges faced during the integration of the RAG pipeline is relevant, but they could provide more detail on how these challenges were specifically addressed. For instance, discussing any iterative processes or adjustments made to improve the integration would strengthen the response.\n\nOverall, the candidate demonstrates a solid understanding of the integration of the RAG pipeline with the LLM, but additional clarifications and examples would enhance the depth of their answer."

        "interviewer": "Thank you for sharing those details. Can you discuss any experience you have with optimizing model performance, particularly in terms of speed and cost efficiency?",
        "candidate": " So far I have not optimized any model. By optimizing I am thinking you mean fine tuning model. So for the specific project fine tuning was not necessary. However, we had to determine which model best suited the specific area of our project. So for example, for the real time conversation where the LLM had to generate questions and interact with the candidate, we went with Claude 3.5 Sonnet which is the most intelligent LLM till date as preferred by most developers. And again for the accuracy verifier we went with ChatGPD 4.0 Mini which is a cut down version of ChatGPD 4.0 which itself is a very powerful LLM. However, 4.0 Mini has the right balance of intelligence and cost effectiveness and also speed. Then for the sentiment analysis we went with Hume AI which is an external service that does the sentiment analysis directly from audio and video feed. So the service, we don't know the specific implementation of the service because we are paying to use the service. And after that getting the sentiment and accuracy verifier score we then feed it into Claude Sonnet 3.5 again to make sense of the answers that the candidate made from both the accuracy verifier and from the sentiment analysis and to give the final verdict of the candidate. So these are the main considerations we made when choosing an LLM.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a high level of concentration (0.43) and contemplation (0.26), coupled with notable confusion (0.20) and determination (0.24), suggesting they were deeply engaged in processing the question while struggling somewhat with formulating their answer, possibly indicating a challenging or complex topic.",
        "feedback": "**Accuracy Percentage:** 75%\n\n**Feedback:**\n\n1. The candidate states that they have not optimized any model, which is accurate in the context of their experience. However, they could have elaborated on the importance of model selection in terms of performance optimization, particularly regarding speed and cost efficiency.\n\n2. The candidate mentions choosing Claude 3.5 Sonnet for real-time conversation and ChatGPT 4.0 Mini for accuracy verification. While they provide reasoning for these choices, they could have included more specific details on how these models were evaluated for speed and cost efficiency, which is a key aspect of the question.\n\n3. The explanation of using Hume AI for sentiment analysis is relevant, but the candidate does not discuss how the integration of this service impacts overall model performance in terms of speed and cost. This omission detracts from the completeness of their answer.\n\n4. The candidate mentions feeding the results from the accuracy verifier and sentiment analysis back into Claude Sonnet 3.5 to derive a final verdict. While this is a valid approach, they could have discussed any challenges faced in this integration process, particularly regarding performance optimization.\n\n5. The candidate's response lacks specific examples or metrics that demonstrate how they assessed the speed and cost efficiency of the models they selected. Providing such details would strengthen their answer and align it more closely with the question's focus on optimizing model performance.\n\nOverall, while the candidate demonstrates a good understanding of model selection and its implications, additional details regarding performance optimization, particularly in terms of speed and cost efficiency, would enhance their response."
