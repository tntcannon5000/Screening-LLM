        "feedback": "The accuracy of the answer provided is 80%.\n\nInaccuracies and feedback:\n\n1. **Current Position**: The candidate mentions they are currently working as a part-time receptionist at the University of Kent.

        "interviewer": "Thank you for sharing that information. It sounds like you have relevant experience with guest services and access management.

Can you give me an example of how you've handled a challenging communication situation with a visitor or staff member in your current position?",
        "candidate": " Sure, so there was a case of double booking where I was left to attend to the customer even though I did not book them and they were pretty angry when they got to their room and found someone else in their room and the best I could do was calm them down and explain to them that this was a fault of the system and not any particular individual and then I had to contact conference in charge of bookings to get them a separate room. Yes, so this is how I handled it.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a mix of emotions dominated by calmness (0.44) and concentration (0.35), but also showed notable levels of tiredness (0.16), disappointment (0.14), and determination (0.12), suggesting they were composed yet somewhat fatigued and potentially dissatisfied while focusing on the interview question.",
        "feedback": "**Accuracy Percentage**: 70%\n\n**Inaccuracies and Feedback**:\n\n1. **Handling of the Situation**: The candidate describes a double booking scenario and mentions calming the customer down and explaining the situation. While this shows an attempt to manage the situation, they could have elaborated on specific communication techniques they used to de-escalate the situation. For example, did they use active listening, empathy, or reassurance? Providing more detail on their approach would demonstrate stronger communication skills.\n\n2. **Resolution Process**: The candidate states they contacted the conference in charge of bookings to get the customer a separate room. However, they could improve their answer by explaining how they ensured the new accommodation met the guest's needs or how they communicated this change to the guest. This would show a more proactive approach to problem-solving and customer service.\n\n3. **Emotional Impact**: The candidate mentions the customer was \"pretty angry,\" but they could enhance their response by discussing how they recognized and validated the guest's feelings. This would illustrate their ability to empathize with guests and handle challenging situations more effectively.\n\nOverall, while the candidate provides a relevant example of a challenging communication situation, they could strengthen their response by including more details about their communication strategies, the resolution process, and their emotional intelligence in handling the guest's frustration."
