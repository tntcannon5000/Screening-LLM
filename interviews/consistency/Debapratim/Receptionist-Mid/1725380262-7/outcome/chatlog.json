        "interviewer": "Hello! Thank you for taking the time to speak with me today about the Part-Time Receptionist position at the University of Edinburgh. I'd like to ask you a few questions to learn more about your qualifications and interest in this role. Could you start by telling me what attracted you to this position?",
        "candidate": " I'm sure. I currently work as a part-time receptionist at the University of Kent and I'm looking to transition into... I mean, I'm looking to move to Edinburgh and this would be a good fit for me since I already have the experience.",
        "feedback": "The accuracy of the answer provided is 80%.\n\n**Inaccuracies:**\n1. The candidate mentions they are currently working as a part-time receptionist at the University of Kent. While this indicates relevant experience, it does not directly address what specifically attracted them to the position at the University of Edinburgh. The answer could have included more details about their interest in the specific role or the university itself.\n2. The phrase \"I'm looking to transition into... I mean, I'm looking to move to Edinburgh\" suggests hesitation or uncertainty, which may not convey confidence in their decision to apply for the position.\n\n**Feedback:**\n- It would be beneficial for the candidate to elaborate on their motivations for applying to the University of Edinburgh specifically, such as the university's reputation, values, or the specific responsibilities of the role that appeal to them.\n- Confidence in expressing their intentions can enhance the impression they make during the interview. Encouraging them to practice articulating their reasons for applying could help in future interviews."

        "interviewer": "That's great to hear about your current experience as a part-time receptionist. Could you tell me more about your specific duties in your current role and how they might relate to this position at the University of Edinburgh?",
        "candidate": " Um, sure. Currently I'm in charge of programming fobs to take guests, sorry, currently I'm in charge of programming fobs to allow guests to have access to specific rooms. I also have to connect guests with housekeeping if they have any problem or to attend any other problems they might have, such as shortage of bed sheets, fans, air trials, etc.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a high level of interest (0.655) and enthusiasm (0.384), coupled with strong concentration (0.123) and determination (0.220), while maintaining a contemplative (0.414) and calm (0.108) demeanor, suggesting a focused and engaged approach to the interview question with a generally positive sentiment (highest values in the 5-6 range) and negligible signs of toxicity.",
        "feedback": "**Accuracy Percentage:** 85%\n\n**Inaccuracies:**\n1. The candidate mentions they are \"in charge of programming fobs to allow guests to have access to specific rooms.\" While this is relevant to the duties of a receptionist, it could be more clearly connected to the responsibilities expected at the University of Edinburgh. The answer could benefit from explicitly stating how this experience translates to the new role.\n2. The phrase \"to attend any other problems they might have, such as shortage of bed sheets, fans, air trials, etc.\" contains a typographical error with \"air trials,\" which likely should be \"air dryers\" or \"air conditioning.\" This could lead to confusion about the specific duties performed.\n\n**Feedback:**\n- It would be helpful for the candidate to elaborate on how their experience with programming fobs and connecting guests with housekeeping directly relates to the responsibilities of the receptionist position at the University of Edinburgh. For example, they could mention skills in customer service, problem-solving, or communication that are applicable to the new role.\n- Clarifying the specific types of issues they handle (e.g., \"shortage of bed sheets\" instead of \"air trials\") would enhance the clarity of their response. This would help the interviewer understand the breadth of their experience and how it aligns with the expectations of the position."

        "interviewer": "Thank you for sharing that information. It sounds like you have relevant experience with guest services and access management. For this role at the University of Edinburgh, strong communication skills are essential. Can you give me an example of how you've handled a challenging communication situation with a visitor or staff member in your current position?",
        "candidate": " Sure, so there was a case of double booking where I was left to attend to the customer even though I did not book them and they were pretty angry when they got to their room and found someone else in their room and the best I could do was calm them down and explain to them that this was a fault of the system and not any particular individual and then I had to contact conference in charge of bookings to get them a separate room. Yes, so this is how I handled it.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a high level of calmness (0.48) and concentration (0.37), while also showing signs of tiredness (0.16) and contemplation (0.13), suggesting they were composed and focused during the interview but may have been experiencing some fatigue or deep thought processes.",
        "feedback": "**Accuracy Percentage:** 75%\n\n**Inaccuracies:**\n1. The candidate describes a situation involving a double booking but does not provide specific details about how they calmed the customer down or the communication techniques they used. This lack of detail makes it difficult to assess their communication skills, which are essential for the role at the University of Edinburgh.\n2. The candidate mentions that the issue was a fault of the system and not any particular individual. While this is a valid point, it could be perceived as deflecting responsibility rather than taking ownership of the situation. A more effective response would include how they took proactive steps to resolve the issue and ensure the customer felt heard and valued.\n\n**Feedback:**\n- It would be beneficial for the candidate to elaborate on the specific communication strategies they employed to calm the angry customer. For example, did they use active listening, empathy, or reassurance? Providing these details would demonstrate their strong communication skills.\n- The candidate should consider framing their response to highlight their role in resolving the issue, emphasizing their problem-solving abilities and commitment to customer satisfaction. This approach would better align with the expectations for the position at the University of Edinburgh."
