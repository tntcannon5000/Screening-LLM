        "interviewer": "Hello! Thank you for taking the time to speak with me today about the Entry-Level Morning Receptionist (Part Time) position at our research institute. I'd like to ask you a few questions to learn more about your qualifications and interest in this role. Could you start by telling me why you're interested in this position?",
        "candidate": " Yes, sure. So I've been working as a part-time receptionist at the University of Kent for a year right now. And I think I'd be qualified in a customer-facing role such as this. Previous to this, I've also worked as a support engineer in big tech companies such as Ingram Micro and TCS, where I had to face customer queries from clients regarding whether the software is working or not. And I'll be graduating the University of Kent in two months, and after that I'm looking for a job in Cambridge, and this happens to be the perfect thing lined up for me.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a blend of positive emotions, with notable levels of calmness (0.22), interest (0.17), and enthusiasm (0.11), while also displaying some awkwardness (0.09) and confusion (0.06), suggesting an engaged but slightly nervous demeanor that is typical in interview settings.",
        "feedback": "**Accuracy Score: 85%**\n\n**Feedback:**\n\n1. **Experience Relevance**: The candidate mentions their experience as a part-time receptionist at the University of Kent, which is relevant to the position. However, they could have elaborated more on specific skills or tasks they performed in that role that directly relate to the responsibilities of a receptionist, such as managing phone calls, scheduling appointments, or handling customer inquiries.\n\n2. **Soft Skills**: While the candidate briefly touches on their customer-facing experience, they do not explicitly mention key soft skills that are essential for a receptionist role, such as being friendly, patient, and having good communication skills. Highlighting these traits would strengthen their response.\n\n3. **Future Aspirations**: The candidate states they are looking for a job in Cambridge after graduation, which is good. However, they could have connected this aspiration more directly to the role they are applying for, explaining how this position aligns with their career goals or interests in the research field.\n\n4. **Clarity and Structure**: The response could benefit from clearer structure. For instance, separating their current experience, past roles, and future aspirations into distinct points would make it easier for the interviewer to follow their narrative.\n\nOverall, the candidate demonstrates relevant experience and a clear interest in the position, but they could enhance their response by emphasizing specific skills and traits that align with the receptionist role."

        "interviewer": "Thank you for sharing that background. It's great to hear about your relevant experience. Could you tell me more about your availability? This position requires opening reception at 8:30 AM and working until 12:45 PM, Monday to Friday. Would you be able to commit to these hours?",
        "candidate": " Yes, sure. After I graduate from university, I will have permission to work 40 hours a week. And apart from that, I am very punctual. Currently, my working hours are from 9 a.m. to 2 a.m. 2 p.m. My bad. And previously, when I worked as a tech support engineer, my working hours were from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Sometimes it extended from 9 a.m. to 10 p.m. depending on heavy workloads. And I was able to deliver to those times. And I think I will be able to deliver for the part-time receptionist role at Cambridge.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited strong determination (0.62) and enthusiasm (0.60), coupled with a high level of concentration (0.19) and interest (0.32), suggesting they were engaged and motivated during the interview, while also displaying a positive emotional state as indicated by the high sentiment scores in the 7-8 range.",
        "feedback": "**Accuracy Score: 70%**\n\n**Feedback:**\n\n1. **Availability Misalignment**: The candidate states they will have permission to work 40 hours a week after graduation. However, the position requires availability for specific hours (8:30 AM to 12:45 PM, Monday to Friday), which totals approximately 20 hours a week. The candidate should have directly addressed their ability to commit to these specific hours rather than focusing on a general 40-hour work week.\n\n2. **Current Working Hours Confusion**: The candidate mentions their current working hours as \"from 9 a.m. to 2 a.m. 2 p.m.\" This appears to be a transcription error, and it should be clarified as \"from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m.\" This confusion could lead to misunderstandings about their current availability.\n\n3. **Relevance of Past Experience**: While the candidate discusses their previous roles, they do not explicitly connect their past experiences to the specific requirements of the receptionist position. They should highlight how their skills from tech support and previous receptionist roles would translate to the responsibilities of the new position.\n\n4. **Punctuality Assurance**: The candidate mentions being punctual, which is a positive trait for a receptionist. However, they could strengthen their response by providing specific examples or situations where their punctuality positively impacted their work or the team.\n\nOverall, while the candidate demonstrates relevant experience and a willingness to work, they need to clarify their availability and better connect their past experiences to the specific requirements of the receptionist role."

        "interviewer": "I see, thank you for that information. This role requires excellent communication and interpersonal skills. Can you give me an example of how you've demonstrated these skills in your previous receptionist or customer service roles?",
        "candidate": " I'm sure. I think the most important customer service or speaking skills come into focus when the customer is agitated. So one such example would be double booking the same room for two different customers. This happened one time when I was at reception even though I was not responsible for that particular booking. So the customer was very angry at the situation and when they approached reception they wanted to get answers. However, I had to take the responsibility on myself and had to have a very apologetic tone when dealing with the customer and to kind of show them that this was an error with the booking system itself not with the reception. And eventually they understood and we were able to book a new room for them. And one such situation from my time as a support engineer would be when I initially joined the role I did not know the layouts of the entire application or the pitfalls of the application I was working on and I had a really high or tense call with a customer since their transactions were not processed at a specific date. I had to get help from my senior support staff and also convince them of the technical difficulties why they could not do and there was nothing that could be done at the moment and if they allowed us two days of time we would enable the transaction and that this would not happen in the future. And the customer was convinced and they continued to use our software from there on. So these are the two circumstances that come into mind when dealing with customers in a very efficient and responsible and apologetic way to cool them down.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a high level of calmness (0.38), concentration (0.20), and contemplation (0.24), coupled with strong feelings of contentment (0.26), determination (0.30), and satisfaction (0.36), indicating a composed and thoughtful demeanor that would be highly suitable for a successful interview.",
        "feedback": "**Accuracy Score: 80%**\n\n**Feedback:**\n\n1. **Example Relevance**: The candidate provides two examples of handling difficult customer situations, which is relevant to demonstrating communication and interpersonal skills. However, the first example about double booking could be more concise. The candidate could focus more on the specific actions they took to resolve the issue and how they communicated with the customer, rather than the context of the booking system error.\n\n2. **Clarity in Communication**: While the candidate describes their approach to handling angry customers, the explanation could be clearer. For instance, they mention using an \"apologetic tone,\" but they could enhance their response by including specific phrases or techniques they used to calm the customer, which would align with the context provided about effective communication with angry customers.\n\n3. **Connection to Role**: The candidate does well to illustrate their experience in customer service, but they could strengthen their response by explicitly connecting their examples to the skills required for the receptionist role. For instance, they could mention how these experiences have prepared them for the specific challenges they might face in the receptionist position.\n\n4. **Emotional Intelligence**: The candidate mentions showing understanding and responsibility, which is good. However, they could elaborate on how they empathized with the customers' feelings during these situations, which is a key aspect of effective communication and interpersonal skills.\n\nOverall, the candidate demonstrates relevant experience and a good understanding of how to handle difficult customer interactions, but they could improve clarity and make stronger connections to the specific skills needed for the receptionist role."

        "interviewer": "Thank you for sharing those examples. One last question: this role requires proficiency with computer systems. Could you briefly describe your experience with various software or systems you've used in your previous roles?",
        "candidate": " I'm sure. I worked as a support engineer in Big Tech for one year. I also worked as a software developer for the last four years of my professional career. So I'm well-honed in programming skills such as Python, Java, using frameworks such as Django and Spring. I'm also well-honed in using Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, and in my current receptionist role, we use a software called Kinetics to book specific rooms and also configure fobs so that the customer has access to their room, hallway, and kitchen, and only their specific room, hallway, and kitchen and not to others. So I would say I'm pretty well-equipped to deal with computer programs.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a high level of contemplation (0.428) and interest (0.308), coupled with significant calmness (0.247) and satisfaction (0.230), suggesting a thoughtful and engaged approach to the interview question while maintaining a composed and positive demeanor.",
        "feedback": "**Accuracy Score: 75%**\n\n**Feedback:**\n\n1. **Experience Relevance**: The candidate mentions their experience as a support engineer and software developer, which is relevant to the role's requirement for proficiency with computer systems. However, they could have provided more specific examples of software or systems they used in those roles, particularly in relation to the receptionist position.\n\n2. **Specific Software Mention**: While the candidate lists programming languages and frameworks (Python, Java, Django, Spring), they do not mention any specific software systems or tools that are directly relevant to the receptionist role. Including examples of software used in customer service or administrative tasks would strengthen their response.\n\n3. **Current Role Software**: The candidate mentions using Kinetics in their current receptionist role, which is good. However, they could elaborate on how they utilized this software effectively, such as specific tasks they performed or challenges they overcame while using it.\n\n4. **Generalization of Skills**: The candidate states they are \"pretty well-equipped to deal with computer programs,\" which is somewhat vague. They could enhance their response by discussing specific skills or experiences that demonstrate their proficiency with computer systems, such as troubleshooting, data entry, or using office productivity software.\n\nOverall, while the candidate demonstrates a solid background in technology and customer service, they need to provide more specific examples and details that directly relate to the proficiency required for the receptionist role."
