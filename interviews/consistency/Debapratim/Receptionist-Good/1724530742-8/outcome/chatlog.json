        "interviewer": "Hello! Thank you for taking the time to speak with me today about the Entry-Level Morning Receptionist (Part Time) position at our research institute. I'd like to ask you a few questions to learn more about your qualifications and interest in this role. Could you start by telling me why you're interested in this position?",
        "candidate": " Yes, sure. So I've been working as a part-time receptionist at the University of Kent for a year right now. And I think I'd be qualified in a customer-facing role such as this. Previous to this, I've also worked as a support engineer in big tech companies such as Ingram Micro and TCS, where I had to face customer queries from clients regarding whether the software is working or not. And I'll be graduating the University of Kent in two months, and after that I'm looking for a job in Cambridge, and this happens to be the perfect thing lined up for me.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a notable level of calmness (0.22) and interest (0.17), coupled with positive surprise (0.17) and enthusiasm (0.11), suggesting an engaged and composed demeanor during the interview, while also displaying some awkwardness (0.09) and boredom (0.09), which might indicate areas for improvement in their interview performance.",
        "feedback": "The accuracy of the answer provided is 85%.\n\nIn the response, the candidate effectively highlights their relevant experience as a part-time receptionist at the University of Kent, which aligns well with the requirements for the Entry-Level Morning Receptionist position. They also mention their previous role as a support engineer, which demonstrates their customer service skills and ability to handle client queries. This is relevant to the skills required for a receptionist role, such as good communication and customer service skills.\n\nHowever, there are a few areas where the answer could be improved:\n\n1. **Clarity on Interest**: While the candidate mentions their experience and the timing of their graduation, they could elaborate more on why they are specifically interested in this position at the research institute. This would help to connect their background to the specific role and organization.\n\n2. **Connection to Skills**: The candidate could have explicitly mentioned how their skills from previous roles (like organization skills, IT skills, and the ability to work with diverse individuals) would be beneficial in the receptionist position. This would strengthen their case for being a good fit for the role.\n\n3. **Future Aspirations**: The candidate states they are looking for a job in Cambridge after graduation, which is relevant, but they could have tied this aspiration more closely to the specific opportunities this position offers, such as gaining experience in a research environment.\n\nOverall, the candidate's experience is relevant, but providing more specific connections to the role and the organization would enhance their response."

        "interviewer": "Thank you for sharing that background. It's great to hear about your relevant experience. Could you tell me more about your availability? This position requires opening reception at 8:30 AM and working until 12:45 PM, Monday to Friday. Would you be able to commit to these hours?",
        "candidate": " Yes, sure. After I graduate from university, I will have permission to work 40 hours a week. And apart from that, I am very punctual. Currently, my working hours are from 9 a.m. to 2 a.m. 2 p.m. My bad. And previously, when I worked as a tech support engineer, my working hours were from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Sometimes it extended from 9 a.m. to 10 p.m. depending on heavy workloads. And I was able to deliver to those times. And I think I will be able to deliver for the part-time receptionist role at Cambridge.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited strong determination (0.62) and enthusiasm (0.60), coupled with high levels of concentration (0.19) and contemplation (0.20), suggesting a focused and passionate approach to the interview question, while also displaying notable levels of excitement (0.30) and interest (0.32) that indicate genuine engagement with the topic at hand.",
        "feedback": "**Accuracy Percentage:** 70%\n\n**Feedback:**\n\n1. **Availability Misalignment**: The candidate states they will have permission to work 40 hours a week after graduation. However, the position requires availability for specific hours (8:30 AM to 12:45 PM, Monday to Friday), which totals approximately 20 hours a week. The candidate should have directly confirmed their ability to commit to these specific hours instead of mentioning a general 40-hour work permission.\n\n2. **Current Working Hours Confusion**: The candidate mentions their current working hours as \"from 9 a.m. to 2 a.m. 2 p.m.\" This appears to be a transcription error, and it should be clarified. However, the mention of working hours does not directly address the question about availability for the receptionist position.\n\n3. **Punctuality Statement**: While the candidate claims to be punctual, they do not provide specific examples or evidence to support this claim. Including a brief example of their punctuality in previous roles would strengthen their response.\n\n4. **Relevance to the Role**: The candidate mentions their experience as a tech support engineer and their ability to handle workloads, but they do not explicitly connect this experience to the skills required for the receptionist role. They could have highlighted how their customer service experience and ability to manage time effectively would be beneficial in this position.\n\nOverall, the candidate's response lacks a direct confirmation of their availability for the specific hours required for the role and does not effectively connect their past experiences to the requirements of the receptionist position."

        "interviewer": "I see, thank you for that information. This role requires excellent communication and interpersonal skills. Can you give me an example of how you've demonstrated these skills in your previous receptionist or customer service roles?",
        "candidate": " I'm sure. I think the most important customer service or speaking skills come into focus when the customer is agitated. So one such example would be double booking the same room for two different customers. This happened one time when I was at reception even though I was not responsible for that particular booking. So the customer was very angry at the situation and when they approached reception they wanted to get answers. However, I had to take the responsibility on myself and had to have a very apologetic tone when dealing with the customer and to kind of show them that this was an error with the booking system itself not with the reception. And eventually they understood and we were able to book a new room for them. And one such situation from my time as a support engineer would be when I initially joined the role I did not know the layouts of the entire application or the pitfalls of the application I was working on and I had a really high or tense call with a customer since their transactions were not processed at a specific date. I had to get help from my senior support staff and also convince them of the technical difficulties why they could not do and there was nothing that could be done at the moment and if they allowed us two days of time we would enable the transaction and that this would not happen in the future. And the customer was convinced and they continued to use our software from there on. So these are the two circumstances that come into mind when dealing with customers in a very efficient and responsible and apologetic way to cool them down.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a balanced and positive emotional state, with high levels of calmness (0.38), contentment (0.26), and satisfaction (0.36), coupled with strong determination (0.30) and concentration (0.20), indicating a composed and focused demeanor suitable for a successful interview performance.",
        "feedback": "**Accuracy Percentage:** 80%\n\n**Feedback:**\n\n1. **Handling Customer Anger**: The candidate provides a relevant example of dealing with an agitated customer due to a double booking. They effectively demonstrate their ability to remain calm, take responsibility, and communicate apologetically, which aligns well with the requirement for excellent communication and interpersonal skills. However, they could have included specific phrases or techniques they used to de-escalate the situation, as suggested in the additional context provided.\n\n2. **Second Example Clarity**: The second example regarding their experience as a support engineer is relevant but could be clearer. The candidate mentions needing help from senior staff and explaining technical difficulties, but they do not specify how they communicated this to the customer. Including more detail about their communication approach would strengthen this example.\n\n3. **Connection to Role**: While the candidate shares two relevant experiences, they could have explicitly tied these examples back to the skills required for the receptionist role. For instance, they could have mentioned how these experiences helped them develop skills in empathy, active listening, and problem-solving, which are crucial for a receptionist position.\n\n4. **Overall Structure**: The response is somewhat lengthy and could benefit from being more concise. Streamlining the examples while maintaining the key points would enhance clarity and impact.\n\nOverall, the candidate demonstrates relevant experience and skills but could improve by providing more specific communication techniques and making clearer connections to the receptionist role."

        "interviewer": "Thank you for sharing those examples. One last question: this role requires proficiency with computer systems. Could you briefly describe your experience with various software or systems you've used in your previous roles?",
        "candidate": " I'm sure. I worked as a support engineer in Big Tech for one year. I also worked as a software developer for the last four years of my professional career. So I'm well-honed in programming skills such as Python, Java, using frameworks such as Django and Spring. I'm also well-honed in using Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, and in my current receptionist role, we use a software called Kinetics to book specific rooms and also configure fobs so that the customer has access to their room, hallway, and kitchen, and only their specific room, hallway, and kitchen and not to others. So I would say I'm pretty well-equipped to deal with computer programs.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a high level of contemplation (0.428) and interest (0.308), coupled with a sense of calmness (0.247) and satisfaction (0.230), suggesting they were thoughtfully engaged with the question while maintaining a composed and positive demeanor, which are generally favorable traits in an interview setting.",
        "feedback": "**Accuracy Percentage:** 75%\n\n**Feedback:**\n\n1. **Experience Relevance**: The candidate mentions their experience as a support engineer and software developer, which is relevant to the role's requirement for proficiency with computer systems. However, they could have provided more specific examples of software or systems they used in those roles, particularly in relation to the receptionist position.\n\n2. **Specific Software Mention**: While the candidate lists programming languages and frameworks (Python, Java, Django, Spring), they do not connect these skills to the receptionist role. It would be beneficial to mention any specific software or systems used in previous receptionist roles or how their technical skills could enhance their performance in this position.\n\n3. **Current Role Software**: The candidate mentions using Kinetics software in their current receptionist role, which is relevant. However, they could elaborate on their proficiency with this software, such as specific tasks they perform or challenges they overcome while using it. This would provide a clearer picture of their capabilities.\n\n4. **General Proficiency Statement**: The candidate concludes by stating they are \"pretty well-equipped to deal with computer programs.\" This statement is vague and could be strengthened by providing concrete examples of how they have successfully used technology in their previous roles to solve problems or improve processes.\n\nOverall, while the candidate demonstrates a solid background in technology and customer service, they could improve their response by providing more specific examples of software proficiency and directly connecting their technical skills to the requirements of the receptionist role."
