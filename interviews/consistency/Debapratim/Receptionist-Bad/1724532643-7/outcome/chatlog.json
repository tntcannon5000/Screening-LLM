        "interviewer": "Hello! Thank you for taking the time to speak with me today about the Entry-Level Morning Receptionist position at our research institute. I'd like to ask you a few questions to learn more about your qualifications and interest in the role. Could you start by telling me what attracted you to this position?",
        "candidate": " Yes, so I needed to make some quick money and I also have some experience as a receptionist working at the University of Kent. I guess the combination of those two.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a notable level of calmness (0.32) and interest (0.22), balanced with moderate levels of positive surprise (0.16), boredom (0.11), and enthusiasm (0.09), while maintaining a generally neutral to slightly positive sentiment (highest values in the 5-6 range), indicating a composed and engaged demeanor with occasional moments of excitement and mild disengagement during the interview.",
        "feedback": "The accuracy of the answer provided is 60%.\n\nFeedback:\n1. The candidate mentioned needing to make \"some quick money,\" which may come across as lacking genuine interest in the role. It's important to express enthusiasm for the position and the organization rather than focusing solely on financial motivation.\n2. While the candidate did mention relevant experience as a receptionist at the University of Kent, they did not elaborate on how that experience specifically relates to the responsibilities of the Entry-Level Morning Receptionist position at the research institute. Providing more detail about relevant skills or experiences would strengthen the response. \n\nOverall, the candidate should aim to convey a stronger interest in the role and connect their past experiences more directly to the position they are applying for."

        "interviewer": "I see. Thank you for sharing that. Could you tell me more about your experience as a receptionist at the University of Kent? What were some of your main responsibilities in that role?",
        "candidate": " I guess some of the main responsibilities was listening to clients complain and sorting out their complaints Making keychains not keychains fobs for guests To lead them to the specific room to help For them to have access to the specific kitchen and always and you know, hmm nothing else",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a high level of contemplation and interest, with notable levels of confusion and awkwardness, suggesting they were deeply engaged in thoughtful consideration of the question while experiencing some uncertainty and discomfort in articulating their response.",
        "feedback": "The accuracy of the answer provided is 50%.\n\nFeedback:\n1. The candidate's response lacks clarity and coherence. Phrases like \"Making keychains not keychains fobs for guests\" are confusing and do not clearly convey the responsibilities associated with the role. This could lead to misunderstandings about their actual duties.\n2. The mention of \"listening to clients complain and sorting out their complaints\" is relevant but could be elaborated upon. It would be beneficial for the candidate to describe how they handled complaints and what skills they utilized in that process.\n3. The phrase \"to lead them to the specific room to help\" is vague. The candidate should specify what kind of assistance they provided and how they guided clients, which would give a better understanding of their role.\n4. The closing statement, \"and always and you know, hmm nothing else,\" indicates uncertainty and a lack of confidence in their response. This could detract from the overall impression of their experience and professionalism. \n\nOverall, the candidate should aim to provide a more structured and detailed account of their responsibilities to better illustrate their experience as a receptionist."

        "interviewer": "Thank you for sharing those details. Can you describe a situation where you had to handle a difficult customer or resolve a complex issue while working at the reception desk?",
        "candidate": " Yeah, a customer came complaining that there was someone else in their room because it was double booked and they were screaming and so I didn't do the booking and yeah, I had to face the consequences, but you know I made them understand that it wasn't my fault and they should raise the complaint somewhere else.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited extremely high levels of annoyance (0.799) and considerable contempt (0.366), disapproval (0.411), and sarcasm (0.293), along with moderate anger (0.225) and disappointment (0.192), suggesting a highly negative emotional state that would be concerning in an interview setting.",
        "feedback": "**Accuracy Score: 40%**\n\n**Feedback:**\n\n1. The candidate's response lacks professionalism and does not demonstrate effective customer service skills. Phrases like \"I didn't do the booking\" and \"they should raise the complaint somewhere else\" suggest a lack of accountability and empathy, which are crucial in handling difficult customers. Instead, the candidate should have focused on how they attempted to resolve the issue or de-escalate the situation.\n\n2. The candidate does not provide any specific actions taken to address the customer's complaint. It would have been beneficial to describe how they communicated with the customer, what steps they took to resolve the issue, or how they ensured the customer felt heard and valued.\n\n3. The overall tone of the response comes across as dismissive rather than understanding. A more effective answer would include a demonstration of patience and a willingness to assist the customer, even if the issue was not directly their fault.\n\n4. The candidate should aim to convey a more positive outcome or resolution to the situation, highlighting their problem-solving skills and ability to maintain composure under pressure."

        "interviewer": "I see. Thank you for sharing that experience. Our receptionist role requires excellent communication skills and the ability to multitask. Can you give an example of how you've managed multiple tasks or priorities simultaneously in a professional setting?",
        "candidate": " Yes, so during my work at reception I do generally get a lot of free time when there are no guests that are coming in. So in this instance I do work on a lot of personal stuff such as writing my dissertation. So in one such instance if a guest comes in I have to prioritize booking the room or creating a for-for the guest and not do my work. So that would be one instance when I multitask or prioritize something more valuable.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited strong feelings of annoyance (0.586) and anger (0.507), coupled with significant distress (0.392) and anxiety (0.155), suggesting a highly negative emotional state that would likely be inappropriate and concerning in an interview setting.",
        "feedback": "**Accuracy Score: 50%**\n\n**Feedback:**\n\n1. The candidate mentions having \"a lot of free time\" during their work at reception, which may imply a lack of engagement with their responsibilities. This could be perceived negatively, as receptionists are typically expected to be attentive and proactive, even during quieter periods.\n\n2. The candidate states they work on \"personal stuff such as writing my dissertation\" during downtime. While it's understandable to utilize free time, it would be more appropriate to focus on how they used that time to improve their skills or assist the organization, rather than personal tasks. This could detract from the impression of their commitment to the role.\n\n3. The example provided about prioritizing booking a room when a guest arrives is relevant, but the explanation is somewhat vague. The candidate should elaborate on how they managed the transition from personal work to attending to the guest, including any specific strategies they used to ensure both tasks were handled effectively.\n\n4. The phrase \"creating a for-for the guest\" appears to be a transcription error, which should be clarified. However, it does not detract from the overall understanding of the candidate's multitasking abilities. \n\n5. The candidate could improve their response by providing a more structured example that clearly outlines the situation, the actions they took, and the outcome. This would better demonstrate their ability to manage multiple tasks and priorities effectively."
