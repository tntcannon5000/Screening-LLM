        "interviewer": "I see. Thank you for sharing that. Could you tell me more about your experience as a receptionist at the University of Kent? What were some of your main responsibilities in that role?",
        "candidate": " I guess some of the main responsibilities was listening to clients complain and sorting out their complaints Making keychains not keychains fobs for guests To lead them to the specific room to help For them to have access to the specific kitchen and always and you know, hmm nothing else",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a high level of contemplation and interest, with notable levels of confusion and awkwardness, suggesting they were deeply engaged in thoughtful consideration of the question while experiencing some uncertainty and discomfort in articulating their response.",
        "feedback": "The accuracy of the answer provided is 50%.\n\nFeedback:\n1. The candidate's response lacks clarity and coherence. Phrases like \"Making keychains not keychains fobs for guests\" are confusing and do not clearly convey the responsibilities associated with the role. This could lead to misunderstandings about their actual duties.\n2. The mention of \"listening to clients complain and sorting out their complaints\" is a valid responsibility, but it could be framed more positively. Instead of focusing on complaints, the candidate could emphasize their role in providing customer service and resolving issues.\n3. The phrase \"always and you know, hmm nothing else\" suggests uncertainty and a lack of confidence in articulating their responsibilities. This detracts from the professionalism expected in a receptionist role.\n4. The candidate did not provide a comprehensive overview of their responsibilities, which would have strengthened their answer. More specific examples of tasks performed would enhance the response and demonstrate their experience more effectively."

        "interviewer": "Thank you for sharing those details. Can you describe a situation where you had to handle a difficult customer or resolve a complex issue while working at the reception desk?",
        "candidate": " Yeah, a customer came complaining that there was someone else in their room because it was double booked and they were screaming and so I didn't do the booking and yeah, I had to face the consequences, but you know I made them understand that it wasn't my fault and they should raise the complaint somewhere else.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited strong feelings of annoyance (0.70) and contempt (0.37), along with notable levels of disapproval (0.36) and sarcasm (0.33), suggesting a highly negative and critical attitude that would likely be inappropriate in most interview contexts.",
        "feedback": "**Accuracy Score: 40%**\n\n**Feedback:**\n\n1. The candidate's response lacks professionalism and does not demonstrate effective customer service skills. Phrases like \"I didn't do the booking\" and \"they should raise the complaint somewhere else\" suggest a lack of accountability and empathy, which are crucial in handling difficult customers. Instead, the candidate should have focused on how they attempted to resolve the issue or de-escalate the situation.\n\n2. The candidate mentions that the customer was \"screaming,\" but does not provide any details on how they managed the situation or what steps they took to calm the customer down. Including specific actions taken to address the customer's concerns would have strengthened the response.\n\n3. The overall tone of the answer comes across as dismissive rather than solution-oriented. A more positive framing, emphasizing the candidate's ability to handle stress and resolve conflicts, would have improved the response significantly.\n\n4. The candidate does not mention any follow-up actions or how the situation was ultimately resolved, which is important in demonstrating their problem-solving skills and commitment to customer satisfaction. Providing a more comprehensive overview of the situation and the resolution would enhance the answer."

        "interviewer": "I see. Thank you for sharing that experience. Our receptionist role requires excellent communication skills and the ability to multitask. Can you give an example of how you've managed multiple tasks or priorities simultaneously in a professional setting?",
        "candidate": " Yes, so during my work at reception I do generally get a lot of free time when there are no guests that are coming in. So in this instance I do work on a lot of personal stuff such as writing my dissertation. So in one such instance if a guest comes in I have to prioritize booking the room or creating a for-for the guest and not do my work. So that would be one instance when I multitask or prioritize something more valuable.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited strong negative emotions, primarily annoyance (0.59) and anger (0.51), along with significant levels of distress (0.39), anxiety (0.16), and confusion (0.15), suggesting they were struggling with the question or situation and reacting poorly to the pressure of the interview.",
        "feedback": "**Accuracy Score: 50%**\n\n**Feedback:**\n\n1. The candidate mentions having \"a lot of free time when there are no guests that are coming in,\" which may imply a lack of engagement with their responsibilities. This could be perceived negatively, as a receptionist should ideally be proactive and find ways to contribute even during quieter times.\n\n2. The candidate states they work on \"personal stuff such as writing my dissertation\" during downtime. While it's understandable to have personal projects, this could be viewed as unprofessional in a work setting. It would be more appropriate to focus on how they utilized downtime to improve their skills or assist the organization.\n\n3. The example provided about prioritizing booking a room when a guest arrives is relevant, but the explanation lacks detail. The candidate could enhance their response by describing specific strategies they used to manage their time effectively or how they balanced their personal tasks with professional responsibilities.\n\n4. The phrase \"creating a for-for the guest\" appears to be a transcription error, which may confuse the reader. It would be beneficial for the candidate to clarify what they meant to ensure their responsibilities are understood correctly.\n\n5. Overall, the response could benefit from a more structured approach, clearly outlining how they manage multiple tasks and providing specific examples of successful multitasking in a professional context."
