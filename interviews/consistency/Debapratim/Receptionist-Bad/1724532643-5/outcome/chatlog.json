        "interviewer": "Hello! Thank you for taking the time to speak with me today about the Entry-Level Morning Receptionist position at our research institute. I'd like to ask you a few questions to learn more about your qualifications and interest in the role. Could you start by telling me what attracted you to this position?",
        "candidate": " Yes, so I needed to make some quick money and I also have some experience as a receptionist working at the University of Kent. I guess the combination of those two.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate displayed a notable level of calmness (0.32) and interest (0.22), with a moderate degree of positive surprise (0.16) and enthusiasm (0.09), while also exhibiting some boredom (0.11), suggesting a composed and engaged demeanor with occasional moments of disengagement, which could be interpreted as a mixed but generally positive emotional state during the interview.",
        "feedback": "The accuracy of the answer provided is 60%.\n\nFeedback:\n1. The candidate mentioned needing to make \"some quick money,\" which may come across as lacking genuine interest in the role. It's important to express enthusiasm for the position and the organization rather than focusing solely on financial motivation.\n2. While the candidate did mention their experience as a receptionist at the University of Kent, they could have elaborated on what specifically attracted them to this particular position at the research institute, such as the opportunity to work in a research environment or contribute to the institute's mission. This would have demonstrated a stronger alignment with the role and the organization. \n\nOverall, the answer could benefit from a more positive framing and a deeper connection to the specific position and its responsibilities."

        "interviewer": "I see. Thank you for sharing that. Could you tell me more about your experience as a receptionist at the University of Kent? What were some of your main responsibilities in that role?",
        "candidate": " I guess some of the main responsibilities was listening to clients complain and sorting out their complaints Making keychains not keychains fobs for guests To lead them to the specific room to help For them to have access to the specific kitchen and always and you know, hmm nothing else",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a high level of contemplation and interest, with notable elements of realization and confusion, suggesting they were deeply engaged in thoughtful consideration of the question while potentially grappling with some aspects of their response.",
        "feedback": "The accuracy of the answer provided is 50%.\n\nFeedback:\n1. The candidate's response lacks clarity and coherence. Phrases like \"Making keychains not keychains fobs for guests\" are confusing and do not clearly convey the responsibilities associated with the role. This could lead to misunderstandings about their actual duties.\n2. The mention of \"listening to clients complain and sorting out their complaints\" is a valid responsibility, but it could be framed more positively. Instead of focusing on complaints, the candidate could emphasize their role in providing customer service and resolving issues, which would reflect a more proactive approach.\n3. The answer is incomplete, as the candidate states \"nothing else\" at the end, which suggests a lack of further responsibilities or engagement in the role. This could give the impression that they did not take their responsibilities seriously or did not have a diverse range of tasks.\n4. Overall, the response could benefit from more detail and a positive framing of their experiences and responsibilities as a receptionist."

        "interviewer": "Thank you for sharing those details. Can you describe a situation where you had to handle a difficult customer or resolve a complex issue while working at the reception desk?",
        "candidate": " Yeah, a customer came complaining that there was someone else in their room because it was double booked and they were screaming and so I didn't do the booking and yeah, I had to face the consequences, but you know I made them understand that it wasn't my fault and they should raise the complaint somewhere else.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited strong feelings of annoyance (0.70) and contempt (0.37), along with notable levels of disapproval (0.36) and sarcasm (0.33), suggesting a highly negative and critical attitude that would likely be inappropriate in most interview settings.",
        "feedback": "**Accuracy Score: 40%**\n\n**Feedback:**\n\n1. The candidate's response lacks professionalism and does not demonstrate effective customer service skills. Phrases like \"I didn't do the booking\" and \"they should raise the complaint somewhere else\" suggest a lack of accountability and empathy, which are crucial in handling difficult customers. Instead, the candidate should have focused on how they attempted to resolve the issue or de-escalate the situation.\n\n2. The candidate mentions that the customer was \"screaming,\" but does not elaborate on how they managed the situation or what steps they took to calm the customer down. Providing specific actions taken to address the customer's concerns would have strengthened the response.\n\n3. The overall tone of the answer comes across as dismissive rather than constructive. A more positive framing, such as emphasizing their efforts to assist the customer or find a solution, would have been more appropriate.\n\n4. The candidate could have included any follow-up actions they took after the incident, such as reporting the issue to a supervisor or ensuring that the booking system was corrected to prevent future occurrences. This would demonstrate a proactive approach to problem-solving."

        "interviewer": "I see. Thank you for sharing that experience. Our receptionist role requires excellent communication skills and the ability to multitask. Can you give an example of how you've managed multiple tasks or priorities simultaneously in a professional setting?",
        "candidate": " Yes, so during my work at reception I do generally get a lot of free time when there are no guests that are coming in. So in this instance I do work on a lot of personal stuff such as writing my dissertation. So in one such instance if a guest comes in I have to prioritize booking the room or creating a for-for the guest and not do my work. So that would be one instance when I multitask or prioritize something more valuable.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited strong feelings of annoyance (0.586) and anger (0.507), coupled with significant distress (0.392) and anxiety (0.155), suggesting a highly negative emotional state that would be concerning in an interview setting, especially given the low scores for positive emotions and the predominantly negative sentiment (0.326 for level 1 and 0.347 for level 2).",
        "feedback": "**Accuracy Score: 50%**\n\n**Feedback:**\n\n1. The candidate mentions having \"a lot of free time\" during their work at reception, which may imply a lack of engagement with their responsibilities. This could be perceived negatively, as it does not reflect the proactive multitasking skills that are essential for a receptionist role.\n\n2. The candidate states they work on \"personal stuff such as writing my dissertation\" during downtime. While it is understandable to utilize free time, it would be more appropriate to focus on how they manage their professional responsibilities during busy periods and how they prioritize tasks related to their role.\n\n3. The example provided about prioritizing booking a room when a guest arrives is relevant, but the explanation lacks detail. The candidate could have elaborated on how they handle the transition from personal work to professional tasks, demonstrating their ability to switch focus effectively and manage time under pressure.\n\n4. The phrase \"creating a for-for the guest\" appears to be a transcription error, which may confuse the reader. It would be beneficial for the candidate to clarify what they meant to convey in that part of the answer.\n\n5. Overall, the response could benefit from a more structured approach, providing clearer examples of multitasking and prioritization in a professional context rather than personal tasks."
