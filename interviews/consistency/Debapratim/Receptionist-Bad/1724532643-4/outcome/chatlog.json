        "interviewer": "Hello! Thank you for taking the time to speak with me today about the Entry-Level Morning Receptionist position at our research institute. I'd like to ask you a few questions to learn more about your qualifications and interest in the role. Could you start by telling me what attracted you to this position?",
        "candidate": " Yes, so I needed to make some quick money and I also have some experience as a receptionist working at the University of Kent. I guess the combination of those two.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a notable level of calmness (0.32) and interest (0.22), along with moderate levels of positive surprise (0.16), boredom (0.11), and enthusiasm (0.09), suggesting a composed and engaged demeanor with occasional moments of excitement, while maintaining a generally positive sentiment (higher scores in 5-9 range) and showing negligible signs of toxicity.",
        "feedback": "The accuracy of the answer provided is 60%.\n\nFeedback:\n1. The candidate mentioned needing to make \"some quick money,\" which may come across as lacking genuine interest in the role. It's important to express enthusiasm for the position and the organization rather than focusing solely on financial motivation.\n2. While the candidate did mention relevant experience as a receptionist at the University of Kent, they did not elaborate on how that experience specifically relates to the responsibilities of the Entry-Level Morning Receptionist position at the research institute. Providing more detail about relevant skills or experiences would strengthen the response. \n\nOverall, the candidate should aim to convey a stronger interest in the role and connect their past experiences more directly to the position they are applying for."

        "interviewer": "I see. Thank you for sharing that. Could you tell me more about your experience as a receptionist at the University of Kent? What were some of your main responsibilities in that role?",
        "candidate": " I guess some of the main responsibilities was listening to clients complain and sorting out their complaints Making keychains not keychains fobs for guests To lead them to the specific room to help For them to have access to the specific kitchen and always and you know, hmm nothing else",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a high level of contemplation and interest, with notable elements of realization and confusion, suggesting they were deeply engaged in thoughtful consideration of the question while potentially grappling with some aspects of their response.",
        "feedback": "The accuracy of the answer provided is 50%.\n\nFeedback:\n1. The candidate's response lacks clarity and coherence. Phrases like \"Making keychains not keychains fobs for guests\" are confusing and do not clearly convey the responsibilities associated with the role. It would be beneficial for the candidate to articulate their tasks more clearly and logically.\n2. The mention of \"listening to clients complain and sorting out their complaints\" is relevant, but it could be expanded to include how they resolved those complaints or the skills they utilized in doing so. This would provide a more comprehensive view of their responsibilities.\n3. The phrase \"always and you know, hmm nothing else\" suggests uncertainty and a lack of confidence in their response. The candidate should aim to provide a more definitive and complete list of responsibilities to demonstrate their experience effectively."

        "interviewer": "Thank you for sharing those details. Can you describe a situation where you had to handle a difficult customer or resolve a complex issue while working at the reception desk?",
        "candidate": " Yeah, a customer came complaining that there was someone else in their room because it was double booked and they were screaming and so I didn't do the booking and yeah, I had to face the consequences, but you know I made them understand that it wasn't my fault and they should raise the complaint somewhere else.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited strong feelings of annoyance (0.69) and contempt (0.37), along with notable levels of disapproval (0.38), anger (0.16), and disgust (0.15), suggesting a highly negative emotional state that could be problematic in a professional interview setting.",
        "feedback": "**Accuracy Score: 40%**\n\n**Feedback:**\n\n1. The candidate's response lacks professionalism and does not demonstrate effective customer service skills. Phrases like \"I didn't do the booking\" and \"they should raise the complaint somewhere else\" suggest a lack of accountability and empathy, which are crucial in handling difficult customers. Instead, the candidate should have focused on how they attempted to resolve the issue or de-escalate the situation.\n\n2. The candidate did not provide any specific actions they took to address the customer's complaint. It would have been beneficial to mention any steps they took to find a solution, such as offering an alternative room, apologizing for the inconvenience, or involving a manager to assist.\n\n3. The overall tone of the response comes across as dismissive rather than understanding. A more effective answer would include a demonstration of active listening and a willingness to help the customer feel heard and valued.\n\n4. The candidate should aim to convey a more positive and proactive approach to customer service, highlighting their problem-solving skills and ability to remain calm under pressure."

        "interviewer": "I see. Thank you for sharing that experience. Our receptionist role requires excellent communication skills and the ability to multitask. Can you give an example of how you've managed multiple tasks or priorities simultaneously in a professional setting?",
        "candidate": " Yes, so during my work at reception I do generally get a lot of free time when there are no guests that are coming in. So in this instance I do work on a lot of personal stuff such as writing my dissertation. So in one such instance if a guest comes in I have to prioritize booking the room or creating a for-for the guest and not do my work. So that would be one instance when I multitask or prioritize something more valuable.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited strong feelings of annoyance and anger, coupled with significant distress and anxiety, suggesting they were struggling to maintain composure during a challenging or frustrating part of the interview, which could be concerning for their ability to handle stress in a professional setting.",
        "feedback": "**Accuracy Score: 45%**\n\n**Feedback:**\n\n1. The candidate mentions having \"a lot of free time\" during their work at reception, which may imply a lack of engagement with their responsibilities. This could be perceived negatively, as a receptionist should ideally be attentive and proactive, even during quieter periods.\n\n2. The candidate states they work on \"personal stuff such as writing my dissertation\" during downtime. This is not an appropriate example of multitasking in a professional setting. Instead, they should focus on how they utilized their time effectively to benefit the reception area or assist guests, even when it was quiet.\n\n3. The example provided about prioritizing booking a room when a guest arrives is relevant, but the explanation lacks detail. The candidate should elaborate on how they manage the transition from personal tasks to professional responsibilities, demonstrating their ability to switch focus and prioritize effectively.\n\n4. The phrase \"creating a for-for the guest\" appears to be a transcription error, which may confuse the reader. The candidate should clarify what they meant to convey in that part of the answer.\n\n5. Overall, the response does not effectively illustrate the candidate's multitasking abilities or their approach to managing priorities in a professional context. They should aim to provide a more structured and relevant example that highlights their skills in communication and multitasking."
