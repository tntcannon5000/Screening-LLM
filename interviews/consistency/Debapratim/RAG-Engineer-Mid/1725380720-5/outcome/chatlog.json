I'd like to ask you a few questions to learn more about your qualifications and interest in this role. Could you start by telling me what attracted you to this position?",
        "candidate": " I'm sure. I currently work as a part-time receptionist at the University of Kent and I'm looking to transition into... I mean, I'm looking to move to Edinburgh and this would be a good fit for me since I already have the experience.",

        "feedback": "The accuracy of the answer provided is 70%.\n\nIn the response, the candidate mentions their current role as a part-time receptionist at the University of Kent, which is relevant experience. However, the answer lacks a clear expression of what specifically attracted them to the position at the University of Edinburgh. While they indicate that moving to Edinburgh and their existing experience make it a good fit, they do not elaborate on their interest in the university or the specific aspects of the role that appeal to them.\n\nFeedback:\n1. The candidate should have elaborated on what specifically attracted them to the University of Edinburgh and the Part-Time Receptionist position. This could include aspects such as the university's reputation, values, or specific responsibilities of the role that align with their career goals.\n2. The phrase \"I'm looking to transition into... I mean, I'm looking to move to Edinburgh\" suggests hesitation and could be more confidently stated. A more direct expression of their intent would strengthen the response. \n\nOverall, while the candidate provides relevant experience, they need to articulate their interest in the position more clearly."

        "candidate": " Um, sure. Currently I'm in charge of programming fobs to take guests, sorry, currently I'm in charge of programming fobs to allow guests to have access to specific rooms.

        "feedback": "The accuracy of the answer provided is 80%.\n\nIn the response, the candidate describes their current duties as a part-time receptionist, specifically mentioning their responsibility for programming fobs for guest access and connecting guests with housekeeping for various issues.

The candidate could have made a clearer connection between their current duties and how they would apply to the role at the University of Edinburgh. While they describe their tasks, they do not explicitly relate these experiences to the responsibilities they might have in the new position.\n\n2. The phrase \"sorry, currently I'm in charge of programming fobs\" suggests a moment of hesitation or confusion. A more confident and fluid delivery would enhance the overall impression of the response.\n\nOverall, while the candidate provides relevant information about their current role, they should focus on explicitly linking their experience to the potential responsibilities at the University of Edinburgh."

        "interviewer": "Thank you for sharing that information. It sounds like you have relevant experience with guest services and access management. For this role at the University of Edinburgh, strong communication skills are essential. Can you give me an example of how you've handled a challenging communication situation with a visitor or staff member in your current position?",
        "candidate": " Sure, so there was a case of double booking where I was left to attend to the customer even though I did not book them and they were pretty angry when they got to their room and found someone else in their room and the best I could do was calm them down and explain to them that this was a fault of the system and not any particular individual and then I had to contact conference in charge of bookings to get them a separate room. Yes, so this is how I handled it.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a high level of concentration (0.68) and determination (0.30), along with moderate levels of interest (0.23) and satisfaction (0.16), suggesting they were deeply engaged and focused on the interview question while maintaining a positive and confident demeanor.",
        "feedback": "**Accuracy Score:** 75%\n\n**Feedback:**\n\n1. **Clarity and Structure:** The candidate's response could benefit from clearer structure. While they describe the situation of double booking, the explanation is somewhat convoluted. A more organized response that clearly outlines the problem, the actions taken, and the outcome would enhance clarity.\n\n2. **Emotional Management:** The candidate mentions calming the customer down, which is a positive aspect. However, they could elaborate on specific techniques or phrases they used to de-escalate the situation. This would demonstrate their communication skills more effectively.\n\n3. **Responsibility and Initiative:** The candidate states that they contacted the conference in charge of bookings to resolve the issue. It would be beneficial to highlight their proactive approach in seeking a solution, as this reflects strong communication and problem-solving skills.\n\n4. **Use of Language:** The phrase \"the best I could do was calm them down\" may imply a lack of confidence in their ability to handle the situation. A more assertive phrasing, such as \"I effectively calmed them down,\" would convey a stronger sense of competence.\n\nOverall, while the candidate provides a relevant example of a challenging communication situation, enhancing the clarity, detail, and assertiveness of their response would improve the overall impression."
