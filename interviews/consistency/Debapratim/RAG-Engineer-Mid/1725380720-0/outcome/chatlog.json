Yes, so this is how I handled it.",

This would demonstrate a more proactive approach to customer service.\n\n3. **Follow-Up Actions**: The answer lacks mention of any follow-up actions taken after resolving the issue, such as checking in with the guest later to ensure their new accommodation met their expectations. Including this would show a commitment to customer satisfaction and thoroughness in their role.\n\nOverall, while the candidate provides a relevant example of handling a challenging communication situation, adding more detail about their communication techniques and follow-up actions would enhance the response."
