The candidate mentions they are \"in charge of programming fobs to allow guests to have access to specific rooms.\" While this is relevant to the role of a receptionist, it could be more clearly connected to the responsibilities expected at the University of Edinburgh. The answer could benefit from explicitly stating how this task relates to ensuring guest satisfaction and security, which are key aspects of a receptionist's role.\n2. The phrase \"to attend any other problems they might have, such as shortage of bed sheets, fans, air trials, etc.\" includes \"air trials,\" which seems to be a transcription error. The intended term might be \"air conditioners\" or \"air quality issues.\" This could lead to confusion about the candidate's responsibilities.\n\n**Feedback:**\n- The candidate should elaborate on how their experience with programming fobs contributes to guest security and satisfaction, which are crucial in a university setting.\n- Clarifying the specific types of issues they assist guests with would strengthen their response.

        "interviewer": "Thank you for sharing that information. It sounds like you have relevant experience with guest services and access management.

        "candidate": " Sure, so there was a case of double booking where I was left to attend to the customer even though I did not book them and they were pretty angry when they got to their room and found someone else in their room and the best I could do was calm them down and explain to them that this was a fault of the system and not any particular individual and then I had to contact conference in charge of bookings to get them a separate room. Yes, so this is how I handled it.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a high level of concentration (0.715) and determination (0.331), coupled with moderate levels of interest (0.233) and contemplation (0.210), suggesting a focused and engaged approach to the interview question, while maintaining a generally neutral to slightly positive sentiment (0.796 in sentiment category 5) without any significant signs of toxicity.",
        "feedback": "**Accuracy Percentage:** 75%\n\n**Inaccuracies:**\n1. The candidate describes a situation involving a double booking but does not provide a clear resolution process that aligns with best practices for handling such situations. According to the context provided, the best solution would be to accommodate the guest in another room of the same or better standard at no extra cost, and to ensure that the guest is not left without accommodation. The candidate's response lacks detail on how they ensured the guest's needs were met beyond just calming them down and contacting the conference in charge of bookings.\n   \n2. The candidate mentions that they explained the situation was a fault of the system and not an individual, which is a good approach to de-escalate the situation. However, they do not elaborate on how they communicated this effectively or what specific steps they took to ensure the guest felt heard and valued during the interaction.\n\n**Feedback:**\n- The candidate should provide more detail on the resolution process they followed after identifying the double booking. This could include how they ensured the guest was accommodated appropriately and any additional steps taken to rectify the situation.\n- It would be beneficial for the candidate to elaborate on their communication strategy during the interaction. For example, they could mention how they listened to the guest's concerns and reassured them that their needs would be prioritized.\n- Including specific outcomes or feedback from the guest after the situation was resolved would strengthen their response and demonstrate their effectiveness in handling challenging communication situations."
