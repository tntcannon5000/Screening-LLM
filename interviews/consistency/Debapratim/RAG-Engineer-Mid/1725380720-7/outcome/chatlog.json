I'd like to ask you a few questions to learn more about your qualifications and interest in this role. Could you start by telling me what attracted you to this position?",
        "candidate": " I'm sure. I currently work as a part-time receptionist at the University of Kent and I'm looking to transition into... I mean, I'm looking to move to Edinburgh and this would be a good fit for me since I already have the experience.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a high level of confusion (0.295) and boredom (0.150), along with moderate levels of awkwardness (0.080) and calmness (0.098), suggesting they may have struggled to understand or engage with the question while attempting to maintain composure, which could be concerning in an interview setting.",
        "feedback": "The accuracy of the answer provided is 70%.\n\nIn the answer, the candidate mentions their current role as a part-time receptionist at the University of Kent, which is relevant experience. However, the response lacks a clear articulation of what specifically attracted them to the position at the University of Edinburgh beyond the desire to move to the city. The candidate could have elaborated on aspects such as the university's reputation, the work environment, or specific responsibilities of the role that appeal to them.\n\nFeedback:\n1. The candidate should provide more detail about their interest in the specific position at the University of Edinburgh. This could include mentioning aspects of the university or the role that resonate with them personally or professionally.\n2. The phrase \"I'm looking to transition into...\" is incomplete and could be confusing. It would be better to clearly state their intention to move to Edinburgh and how this position aligns with their career goals. \n\nOverall, while the candidate has relevant experience, they need to better express their motivation for applying to this specific role."

        "interviewer": "That's great to hear about your current experience as a part-time receptionist. Could you tell me more about your specific duties in your current role and how they might relate to this position at the University of Edinburgh?",
        "candidate": " Um, sure. Currently I'm in charge of programming fobs to take guests, sorry, currently I'm in charge of programming fobs to allow guests to have access to specific rooms. I also have to connect guests with housekeeping if they have any problem or to attend any other problems they might have, such as shortage of bed sheets, fans, air trials, etc.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited extremely high levels of concentration (0.97) and determination (0.54), coupled with moderate levels of interest (0.28), satisfaction (0.22), and enthusiasm (0.19), suggesting a focused and engaged demeanor that would likely be viewed positively in an interview setting.",
        "feedback": "The accuracy of the answer provided is 80%.\n\nIn the answer, the candidate describes their current responsibilities, which include programming fobs for guest access and connecting guests with housekeeping for various issues. This information is relevant to the role of a receptionist and demonstrates their experience in managing guest services.\n\nHowever, there are a few areas where the answer could be improved:\n\n1. **Connection to the University of Edinburgh Position**: The candidate does not explicitly relate their current duties to the specific position at the University of Edinburgh. It would strengthen their response to mention how their experience with guest access and problem-solving aligns with the expectations of the role they are applying for.\n\n2. **Clarity and Structure**: The candidate's response could benefit from clearer structure. The phrase \"sorry, currently I'm in charge of programming fobs\" suggests a moment of hesitation that could be perceived as unprofessional. A more confident delivery would enhance the overall impression.\n\n3. **Detail on Problem-Solving**: While the candidate mentions connecting guests with housekeeping for issues, providing a specific example of a problem they resolved could illustrate their problem-solving skills and customer service abilities more effectively.\n\nOverall, while the candidate provides relevant information about their current role, they should focus on making explicit connections to the new position and presenting their experience in a more structured manner."

        "interviewer": "Thank you for sharing that information. It sounds like you have relevant experience with guest services and access management. For this role at the University of Edinburgh, strong communication skills are essential. Can you give me an example of how you've handled a challenging communication situation with a visitor or staff member in your current position?",
        "candidate": " Sure, so there was a case of double booking where I was left to attend to the customer even though I did not book them and they were pretty angry when they got to their room and found someone else in their room and the best I could do was calm them down and explain to them that this was a fault of the system and not any particular individual and then I had to contact conference in charge of bookings to get them a separate room. Yes, so this is how I handled it.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a high level of concentration (0.70) and determination (0.33), coupled with moderate levels of contemplation (0.18), interest (0.19), and satisfaction (0.18), suggesting a focused and engaged approach to the interview question while maintaining a generally neutral emotional state as indicated by the dominant sentiment score in the middle range (0.82 for level 5).",
        "feedback": "**Accuracy Score: 75%**\n\n**Feedback:**\n\n1. **Clarity of Situation**: The candidate describes a challenging situation involving a double booking, which is relevant to the question about handling communication challenges. However, the explanation could be clearer. The phrase \"I was left to attend to the customer even though I did not book them\" could be rephrased to indicate that they were not responsible for the booking error, which would help clarify their role in the situation.\n\n2. **Emotional Management**: While the candidate mentions calming the customer down, they could provide more detail on the specific techniques or strategies they used to de-escalate the situation. This would demonstrate their communication skills more effectively.\n\n3. **Resolution Process**: The candidate states that they contacted the conference in charge of bookings to get the customer a separate room. It would strengthen the answer to include how they communicated this to the customer and whether they followed up to ensure the issue was resolved satisfactorily.\n\n4. **Professionalism**: The phrase \"the best I could do was calm them down\" may come across as somewhat dismissive. A more positive framing, such as \"I focused on calming them down and ensuring they felt heard,\" would reflect a more professional approach to customer service.\n\nOverall, while the candidate provides a relevant example of a challenging communication situation, enhancing the clarity, emotional management, and resolution aspects of their response would improve the overall effectiveness of their answer."
