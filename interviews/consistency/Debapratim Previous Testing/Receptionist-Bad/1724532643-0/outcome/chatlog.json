        "interviewer": "Hello! Thank you for taking the time to speak with me today about the Entry-Level Morning Receptionist position at our research institute. I'd like to ask you a few questions to learn more about your qualifications and interest in the role. Could you start by telling me what attracted you to this position?",
        "candidate": " Yes, so I needed to make some quick money and I also have some experience as a receptionist working at the University of Kent. I guess the combination of those two.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a notable level of calmness (0.32) and interest (0.22), along with moderate levels of positive surprise (0.16) and boredom (0.11), suggesting they were engaged but perhaps not fully enthusiastic, while maintaining a generally positive sentiment (higher scores in 5-9 range) and showing negligible signs of toxicity.",
        "feedback": "The accuracy of the answer provided is 60%.\n\nFeedback:\n1. The candidate mentioned needing to make \"some quick money,\" which may come across as lacking genuine interest in the role. It's important to express enthusiasm for the position and the organization rather than focusing solely on financial motivation.\n2. While the candidate did mention their experience as a receptionist at the University of Kent, they could have elaborated on what specific skills or experiences from that role would make them a good fit for the Entry-Level Morning Receptionist position at the research institute. Providing more detail about relevant skills or experiences would strengthen their response. \n\nOverall, the answer could benefit from a more positive framing and additional details about their qualifications and interest in the specific role."

        "interviewer": "I see. Thank you for sharing that. Could you tell me more about your experience as a receptionist at the University of Kent? What were some of your main responsibilities in that role?",
        "candidate": " I guess some of the main responsibilities was listening to clients complain and sorting out their complaints Making keychains not keychains fobs for guests To lead them to the specific room to help For them to have access to the specific kitchen and always and you know, hmm nothing else",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a high level of contemplation and interest, with notable elements of realization and confusion, suggesting they were deeply engaged in thoughtful consideration of the question while potentially grappling with some aspects of their response.",
        "feedback": "The accuracy of the answer provided is 50%.\n\nFeedback:\n1. The candidate's response lacks clarity and coherence. Phrases like \"Making keychains not keychains fobs for guests\" are confusing and do not clearly convey the responsibilities associated with the role. This could lead to misunderstandings about their actual duties.\n2. The mention of \"listening to clients complain and sorting out their complaints\" is a valid responsibility, but it could be framed more positively. Instead of focusing on complaints, the candidate could emphasize their role in providing customer service and resolving issues.\n3. The phrase \"always and you know, hmm nothing else\" suggests a lack of confidence or completeness in their answer. It would be beneficial for the candidate to provide a more comprehensive overview of their responsibilities, which would demonstrate their experience and skills more effectively."

        "interviewer": "Thank you for sharing those details. Can you describe a situation where you had to handle a difficult customer or resolve a complex issue while working at the reception desk?",
        "candidate": " Yeah, a customer came complaining that there was someone else in their room because it was double booked and they were screaming and so I didn't do the booking and yeah, I had to face the consequences, but you know I made them understand that it wasn't my fault and they should raise the complaint somewhere else.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited strong feelings of annoyance (0.77) and disapproval (0.36), coupled with notable levels of contempt (0.33) and sarcasm (0.34), suggesting a highly negative and potentially confrontational attitude that would be concerning in an interview setting.",
        "feedback": "**Accuracy Score: 40%**\n\n**Feedback:**\n\n1. The candidate's response lacks professionalism and does not demonstrate effective customer service skills. Phrases like \"I didn't do the booking\" and \"they should raise the complaint somewhere else\" suggest a lack of accountability and empathy, which are crucial in handling difficult customers. Instead, the candidate should have focused on how they attempted to resolve the issue or de-escalate the situation.\n\n2. The candidate mentions that the customer was \"screaming,\" but does not elaborate on how they managed the situation or what steps they took to calm the customer down. Providing specific actions taken to address the customer's concerns would have strengthened the response.\n\n3. The overall tone of the answer comes across as dismissive rather than constructive. A more positive framing, emphasizing problem-solving and customer satisfaction, would be more appropriate for a reception desk role.\n\n4. The candidate could have included any follow-up actions they took to ensure the customer felt heard or to prevent similar issues in the future, which would demonstrate a proactive approach to customer service."

        "interviewer": "I see. Thank you for sharing that experience. Our receptionist role requires excellent communication skills and the ability to multitask. Can you give an example of how you've managed multiple tasks or priorities simultaneously in a professional setting?",
        "candidate": " Yes, so during my work at reception I do generally get a lot of free time when there are no guests that are coming in. So in this instance I do work on a lot of personal stuff such as writing my dissertation. So in one such instance if a guest comes in I have to prioritize booking the room or creating a for-for the guest and not do my work. So that would be one instance when I multitask or prioritize something more valuable.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited strong feelings of annoyance and anger, coupled with significant levels of distress, embarrassment, and confusion, suggesting they were struggling with a challenging or frustrating situation during the interview, which could be concerning for their ability to handle stress or difficult scenarios in a professional setting.",
        "feedback": "**Accuracy Score: 45%**\n\n**Feedback:**\n\n1. The candidate mentions having \"a lot of free time\" during their work at reception, which may imply a lack of engagement with their responsibilities. This could be perceived negatively, as receptionists are typically expected to be attentive and proactive, even during quieter periods.\n\n2. The candidate states they work on \"personal stuff such as writing my dissertation\" during downtime. While it's understandable to utilize free time, it would be more appropriate to focus on how they used that time to improve their skills or assist the organization, rather than personal tasks.\n\n3. The phrase \"creating a for-for the guest\" appears to be a transcription error. It should likely be \"creating a folder for the guest.\" This confusion detracts from the clarity of the response and could lead to misunderstandings about their duties.\n\n4. The candidate's example of multitasking is not particularly strong. They mention prioritizing booking a room over their personal work, but they do not provide a clear example of a situation where they effectively managed multiple tasks simultaneously. A more concrete example demonstrating their ability to juggle responsibilities would enhance their response.\n\n5. Overall, the response lacks detail and specificity regarding how they manage multiple tasks. Providing a more structured example, including the context, actions taken, and outcomes, would better illustrate their multitasking abilities."
