I'd like to ask you a few questions to learn more about your qualifications and interest in the role. Could you start by telling me what attracted you to this position?",
        "candidate": " Yes, so I needed to make some quick money and I also have some experience as a receptionist working at the University of Kent. I guess the combination of those two.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a notable level of calmness (0.32) and interest (0.22), along with moderate levels of positive surprise (0.16) and enthusiasm (0.09), suggesting an engaged and composed demeanor during the interview, although a slight undercurrent of boredom (0.11) was also detected, which could potentially be a point of concern for their overall enthusiasm for the position.",
        "feedback": "The accuracy of the answer provided is 60%.\n\nFeedback:\n1. The candidate mentioned needing to make \"some quick money,\" which may come across as lacking genuine interest in the role. It's important to express enthusiasm for the position and the organization rather than focusing solely on financial motivation.\n2. While the candidate did mention their experience as a receptionist at the University of Kent, they could have elaborated on what specific skills or experiences from that role would make them a good fit for the Entry-Level Morning Receptionist position at the research institute. Providing more detail about relevant skills or experiences would strengthen their response. \n\nOverall, the answer could benefit from a more positive framing and additional details about their qualifications and interest in the specific role."

        "interviewer": "I see. Thank you for sharing that. Could you tell me more about your experience as a receptionist at the University of Kent? What were some of your main responsibilities in that role?",
        "candidate": " I guess some of the main responsibilities was listening to clients complain and sorting out their complaints Making keychains not keychains fobs for guests To lead them to the specific room to help For them to have access to the specific kitchen and always and you know, hmm nothing else",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a high level of contemplation and interest, with notable levels of confusion and awkwardness, suggesting they were deeply engaged in thoughtful consideration of the question while experiencing some uncertainty and discomfort in formulating their response.",
        "feedback": "The accuracy of the answer provided is 40%.\n\nFeedback:\n1. The candidate's response lacks clarity and coherence. Phrases like \"Making keychains not keychains fobs for guests\" are confusing and do not clearly convey the responsibilities associated with the receptionist role. This could lead to misunderstandings about their actual duties.\n2. The mention of \"listening to clients complain and sorting out their complaints\" is a valid responsibility, but it should be framed more positively. Instead of focusing on complaints, the candidate could emphasize their role in providing customer service and resolving issues.\n3. The phrase \"always and you know, hmm nothing else\" suggests a lack of confidence or completeness in their answer. It would be beneficial for the candidate to provide a more comprehensive overview of their responsibilities, which would demonstrate their experience and skills more effectively. \n\nOverall, the answer could be improved by providing clearer and more structured information about their responsibilities, as well as a more positive framing of their experiences."

        "interviewer": "Thank you for sharing those details. Can you describe a situation where you had to handle a difficult customer or resolve a complex issue while working at the reception desk?",
        "candidate": " Yeah, a customer came complaining that there was someone else in their room because it was double booked and they were screaming and so I didn't do the booking and yeah, I had to face the consequences, but you know I made them understand that it wasn't my fault and they should raise the complaint somewhere else.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a high level of annoyance (0.796) and considerable contempt (0.360), disapproval (0.438), and sarcasm (0.255), along with moderate levels of anger (0.222) and disappointment (0.214), suggesting a strongly negative emotional state that would be concerning in an interview setting.",
        "feedback": "**Accuracy Score: 30%**\n\n**Feedback:**\n\n1. The candidate's response lacks professionalism and does not demonstrate effective customer service skills. Phrases like \"I didn't do the booking\" and \"they should raise the complaint somewhere else\" suggest a lack of accountability and empathy, which are crucial in handling difficult customers. Instead, the candidate should have focused on how they attempted to resolve the issue or de-escalate the situation.\n\n2. The answer does not provide specific details about the actions taken to address the customer's complaint. A more effective response would include steps taken to resolve the issue, such as offering an alternative room, apologizing for the inconvenience, or involving a manager to assist.\n\n3. The overall tone of the response comes across as dismissive rather than understanding. It is important for a receptionist to convey empathy and a willingness to help, even in challenging situations. The candidate should have emphasized their commitment to customer satisfaction and problem-solving.\n\n4. The candidate's use of informal language (\"yeah,\" \"you know\") detracts from the professionalism expected in a receptionist role. A more formal tone would be appropriate when discussing customer interactions."

        "interviewer": "I see. Thank you for sharing that experience. Our receptionist role requires excellent communication skills and the ability to multitask. Can you give an example of how you've managed multiple tasks or priorities simultaneously in a professional setting?",
        "candidate": " Yes, so during my work at reception I do generally get a lot of free time when there are no guests that are coming in. So in this instance I do work on a lot of personal stuff such as writing my dissertation. So in one such instance if a guest comes in I have to prioritize booking the room or creating a for-for the guest and not do my work. So that would be one instance when I multitask or prioritize something more valuable.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited strong feelings of annoyance (0.586) and anger (0.507), coupled with significant distress (0.392) and anxiety (0.155), suggesting a highly negative emotional state that would be concerning in an interview setting.",
        "feedback": "**Accuracy Score: 40%**\n\n**Feedback:**\n\n1. The candidate mentions having \"a lot of free time\" during their work at reception, which may imply a lack of engagement with their responsibilities. This could be perceived negatively, as a receptionist should ideally be attentive and proactive in their role, even during quieter periods.\n\n2. The candidate states they work on \"personal stuff such as writing my dissertation\" during downtime. While it's understandable to utilize free time, it would be more appropriate to focus on how they use that time to improve their skills or assist the organization, rather than personal tasks. This could give the impression that they are not fully committed to their role.\n\n3. The example provided about prioritizing booking a room when a guest arrives is relevant, but the explanation lacks detail. The candidate could enhance their response by describing specific actions taken to manage the situation effectively, such as how they quickly shifted focus from personal tasks to customer service.\n\n4. The phrase \"creating a for-for the guest\" appears to be a transcription error and should be clarified. However, this does not detract from the overall understanding of the candidate's multitasking abilities.\n\n5. Overall, the response could benefit from a more positive framing of their responsibilities and a clearer demonstration of their ability to prioritize tasks effectively in a professional setting."
