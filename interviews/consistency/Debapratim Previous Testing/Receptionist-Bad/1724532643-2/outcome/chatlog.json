        "interviewer": "Hello! Thank you for taking the time to speak with me today about the Entry-Level Morning Receptionist position at our research institute. I'd like to ask you a few questions to learn more about your qualifications and interest in the role. Could you start by telling me what attracted you to this position?",
        "candidate": " Yes, so I needed to make some quick money and I also have some experience as a receptionist working at the University of Kent. I guess the combination of those two.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a notable level of calmness (0.32) and interest (0.22), along with moderate levels of positive surprise (0.16) and enthusiasm (0.09), suggesting an engaged and composed demeanor, although a slight undercurrent of boredom (0.11) was also present, potentially indicating room for improvement in maintaining consistent enthusiasm throughout the interview.",
        "feedback": "The accuracy of the answer provided is 60%.\n\nFeedback:\n1. The candidate mentioned needing to make \"some quick money,\" which may come across as less professional and could imply a lack of genuine interest in the role. It would be more effective to express enthusiasm for the position and how it aligns with their career goals or interests.\n2. While the candidate did mention their experience as a receptionist at the University of Kent, they did not elaborate on how that experience specifically relates to the responsibilities of the Entry-Level Morning Receptionist position at the research institute. Providing more detail about relevant skills or experiences would strengthen their response. \n\nOverall, the answer could benefit from a more positive framing and a clearer connection to the specific role being applied for."

        "interviewer": "I see. Thank you for sharing that. Could you tell me more about your experience as a receptionist at the University of Kent? What were some of your main responsibilities in that role?",
        "candidate": " I guess some of the main responsibilities was listening to clients complain and sorting out their complaints Making keychains not keychains fobs for guests To lead them to the specific room to help For them to have access to the specific kitchen and always and you know, hmm nothing else",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a high level of contemplation and interest, with notable elements of realization and confusion, suggesting they were deeply engaged in thoughtful consideration of the question while potentially grappling with some aspects of their response.",
        "feedback": "The accuracy of the answer provided is 50%.\n\nFeedback:\n1. The candidate's response lacks clarity and coherence. Phrases like \"Making keychains not keychains fobs for guests\" are confusing and do not clearly convey the responsibilities associated with the role. It would be beneficial for the candidate to articulate their tasks more clearly and logically.\n2. The mention of \"listening to clients complain and sorting out their complaints\" is a valid responsibility, but it could be framed more positively. Instead of focusing on complaints, the candidate could emphasize their role in providing customer service and resolving issues effectively.\n3. The phrase \"always and you know, hmm nothing else\" suggests uncertainty and a lack of confidence in their response. The candidate should aim to provide a more comprehensive overview of their responsibilities, which would demonstrate their competence and experience in the role. \n\nOverall, the answer could be improved by providing clearer, more structured information about the candidate's responsibilities and focusing on positive aspects of their experience."

        "interviewer": "Thank you for sharing those details. Can you describe a situation where you had to handle a difficult customer or resolve a complex issue while working at the reception desk?",
        "candidate": " Yeah, a customer came complaining that there was someone else in their room because it was double booked and they were screaming and so I didn't do the booking and yeah, I had to face the consequences, but you know I made them understand that it wasn't my fault and they should raise the complaint somewhere else.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited strong feelings of annoyance (0.77) and disapproval (0.36), coupled with notable levels of contempt (0.33) and sarcasm (0.34), suggesting a highly negative and potentially confrontational attitude that would be concerning in an interview setting.",
        "feedback": "**Accuracy Score: 40%**\n\n**Feedback:**\n\n1. The candidate's response lacks professionalism and does not demonstrate effective customer service skills. Phrases like \"I didn't do the booking\" and \"they should raise the complaint somewhere else\" suggest a lack of accountability and empathy, which are crucial in a receptionist role. Instead, the candidate should focus on how they attempted to resolve the issue or assist the customer, even if the problem was not their fault.\n\n2. The candidate mentions that the customer was \"screaming,\" which could have been addressed more constructively. Instead of highlighting the customer's negative behavior, the candidate could have described how they remained calm and worked to de-escalate the situation.\n\n3. The overall tone of the response comes across as dismissive rather than solution-oriented. A more effective answer would include specific actions taken to address the customer's concerns, such as offering alternatives or involving a manager to help resolve the issue.\n\n4. The candidate does not provide any details about how they communicated with the customer or what steps they took to ensure the customer felt heard and valued. Including these details would enhance the response and demonstrate their ability to handle difficult situations effectively."

        "interviewer": "I see. Thank you for sharing that experience. Our receptionist role requires excellent communication skills and the ability to multitask. Can you give an example of how you've managed multiple tasks or priorities simultaneously in a professional setting?",
        "candidate": " Yes, so during my work at reception I do generally get a lot of free time when there are no guests that are coming in. So in this instance I do work on a lot of personal stuff such as writing my dissertation. So in one such instance if a guest comes in I have to prioritize booking the room or creating a for-for the guest and not do my work. So that would be one instance when I multitask or prioritize something more valuable.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited strong feelings of annoyance (0.586) and anger (0.507), coupled with significant distress (0.392) and anxiety (0.155), suggesting a highly negative emotional state that would be concerning in an interview setting and potentially indicative of poor stress management or interpersonal skills.",
        "feedback": "**Accuracy Score: 50%**\n\n**Feedback:**\n\n1. The candidate mentions having \"a lot of free time when there are no guests that are coming in,\" which may imply a lack of engagement with their responsibilities. It would be more effective to focus on how they utilize downtime productively, perhaps by preparing for future guests or organizing the reception area.\n\n2. The candidate states they work on \"personal stuff such as writing my dissertation.\" While it's understandable to have personal projects, mentioning this in a professional context may not reflect well on their prioritization of work responsibilities. It would be better to emphasize tasks related to the receptionist role during quieter times.\n\n3. The phrase \"creating a for-for the guest\" appears to be a transcription error. Assuming it was meant to refer to creating a \"folder\" or \"form,\" the candidate should clarify what this entails and how it contributes to their multitasking abilities.\n\n4. The candidate's example of prioritizing booking a room when a guest arrives is relevant, but they could enhance their response by providing more detail on how they manage the transition from personal tasks to guest service. For instance, they could describe specific strategies they use to quickly switch focus and ensure excellent service.\n\n5. Overall, the response lacks depth in illustrating their multitasking skills. Providing a more structured example that includes specific actions taken and the outcomes achieved would strengthen their answer."
