        "interviewer": "Hello! Thank you for taking the time to speak with me today about the Entry-Level Morning Receptionist (Part Time) position at our research institute. I'd like to ask you a few questions to learn more about your qualifications and interest in this role. Could you start by telling me why you're interested in this position?",
        "candidate": " Yes, sure. So I've been working as a part-time receptionist at the University of Kent for a year right now. And I think I'd be qualified in a customer-facing role such as this. Previous to this, I've also worked as a support engineer in big tech companies such as Ingram Micro and TCS, where I had to face customer queries from clients regarding whether the software is working or not. And I'll be graduating the University of Kent in two months, and after that I'm looking for a job in Cambridge, and this happens to be the perfect thing lined up for me.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a balanced mix of emotions, with notably high levels of calmness (0.22), interest (0.17), and positive surprise (0.17), alongside moderate levels of enthusiasm (0.11) and amusement (0.09), indicating a generally positive and engaged demeanor during the interview, although some awkwardness (0.09) and confusion (0.06) were also present, suggesting potential areas for improvement in their communication or understanding.",
        "feedback": "The accuracy of the answer provided is 85%.\n\nIn the response, the candidate effectively highlights their relevant experience as a part-time receptionist and their previous role as a support engineer, which demonstrates their customer service skills. However, there are a few areas where the answer could be improved:\n\n1. **Connection to the Role**: While the candidate mentions their experience, they could strengthen their response by explicitly connecting their skills and experiences to the specific requirements of the receptionist position, such as being friendly, patient, and having good communication skills. This would show a deeper understanding of what the role entails.\n\n2. **Interest in the Organization**: The candidate does not express any specific interest in the research institute itself. Mentioning why they are drawn to this particular organization or its mission could enhance their answer and demonstrate a genuine interest in the position.\n\n3. **Future Aspirations**: The candidate states they are looking for a job in Cambridge after graduation, which is relevant, but they could elaborate on how this position aligns with their career goals or aspirations in the field of administration or customer service.\n\nOverall, the candidate has a solid foundation in their response, but adding more specific connections to the role and the organization would improve the overall effectiveness of their answer."

        "interviewer": "Thank you for sharing that background. It's great to hear about your relevant experience. Could you tell me more about your availability? This position requires opening reception at 8:30 AM and working until 12:45 PM, Monday to Friday. Would you be able to commit to these hours?",
        "candidate": " Yes, sure. After I graduate from university, I will have permission to work 40 hours a week. And apart from that, I am very punctual. Currently, my working hours are from 9 a.m. to 2 a.m. 2 p.m. My bad. And previously, when I worked as a tech support engineer, my working hours were from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Sometimes it extended from 9 a.m. to 10 p.m. depending on heavy workloads. And I was able to deliver to those times. And I think I will be able to deliver for the part-time receptionist role at Cambridge.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited strong determination (0.62) and enthusiasm (0.60), coupled with a high level of concentration (0.19) and interest (0.32), suggesting they were engaged and motivated during the interview, while also displaying a balanced mix of positive sentiments (high scores in 7 and 8) that indicate a favorable and confident attitude towards the topic of discussion.",
        "feedback": "**Accuracy Percentage**: 70%\n\n**Feedback**:\n\n1. **Availability Misunderstanding**: The candidate states they will have permission to work 40 hours a week after graduation. However, based on the context provided, full-time students on a student visa are restricted to working a maximum of 20 hours per week during term time. This discrepancy indicates a misunderstanding of the working restrictions associated with their visa status.\n\n2. **Commitment to Specific Hours**: The candidate does not directly address the specific hours required for the receptionist position (8:30 AM to 12:45 PM, Monday to Friday). While they mention their punctuality and previous working hours, they should explicitly confirm their ability to commit to the specified schedule.\n\n3. **Clarity on Current Working Hours**: The candidate's current working hours are stated as \"from 9 a.m. to 2 a.m. 2 p.m.\" This appears to be a transcription error, and it should be clarified as \"from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m.\" for better understanding.\n\n4. **Relevance of Previous Experience**: While the candidate mentions their experience as a tech support engineer, they could strengthen their response by emphasizing how this experience translates to skills relevant to a receptionist role, such as communication and customer service.\n\nOverall, the candidate's response contains relevant information but lacks clarity on their availability and understanding of visa restrictions, which are critical for this position."

        "interviewer": "I see, thank you for that information. This role requires excellent communication and interpersonal skills. Can you give me an example of how you've demonstrated these skills in your previous receptionist or customer service roles?",
        "candidate": " I'm sure. I think the most important customer service or speaking skills come into focus when the customer is agitated. So one such example would be double booking the same room for two different customers. This happened one time when I was at reception even though I was not responsible for that particular booking. So the customer was very angry at the situation and when they approached reception they wanted to get answers. However, I had to take the responsibility on myself and had to have a very apologetic tone when dealing with the customer and to kind of show them that this was an error with the booking system itself not with the reception. And eventually they understood and we were able to book a new room for them. And one such situation from my time as a support engineer would be when I initially joined the role I did not know the layouts of the entire application or the pitfalls of the application I was working on and I had a really high or tense call with a customer since their transactions were not processed at a specific date. I had to get help from my senior support staff and also convince them of the technical difficulties why they could not do and there was nothing that could be done at the moment and if they allowed us two days of time we would enable the transaction and that this would not happen in the future. And the customer was convinced and they continued to use our software from there on. So these are the two circumstances that come into mind when dealing with customers in a very efficient and responsible and apologetic way to cool them down.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a blend of positive emotional states, with high levels of calmness (0.38), satisfaction (0.36), and contentment (0.26), alongside notable determination (0.30) and concentration (0.20), suggesting a composed and focused demeanor that would be highly suitable for a successful interview.",
        "feedback": "**Accuracy Percentage**: 80%\n\n**Feedback**:\n\n1. **Handling Customer Anger**: The candidate provides a relevant example of dealing with an agitated customer due to a double booking. They effectively demonstrate their ability to remain calm, take responsibility, and communicate apologetically, which aligns well with the requirement for excellent communication and interpersonal skills. However, they could enhance their response by explicitly mentioning the use of specific phrases or techniques for calming the customer, as suggested in the additional context provided.\n\n2. **Second Example Clarity**: The second example regarding their experience as a support engineer is relevant but could be clearer. The candidate mentions needing help from senior staff and explaining technical difficulties, but they could improve the clarity of how they communicated with the customer during this tense situation. Including specific phrases or strategies used to convey understanding and empathy would strengthen this example.\n\n3. **Connection to Role Requirements**: While the candidate demonstrates their experience in handling difficult situations, they could make a more explicit connection to the specific skills required for the receptionist role, such as being friendly, patient, and having good communication skills. This would show a deeper understanding of the role's expectations.\n\nOverall, the candidate's response is strong, but adding more specific techniques for managing customer interactions and explicitly linking their experiences to the role's requirements would enhance the effectiveness of their answer."

        "interviewer": "Thank you for sharing those examples. One last question: this role requires proficiency with computer systems. Could you briefly describe your experience with various software or systems you've used in your previous roles?",
        "candidate": " I'm sure. I worked as a support engineer in Big Tech for one year. I also worked as a software developer for the last four years of my professional career. So I'm well-honed in programming skills such as Python, Java, using frameworks such as Django and Spring. I'm also well-honed in using Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, and in my current receptionist role, we use a software called Kinetics to book specific rooms and also configure fobs so that the customer has access to their room, hallway, and kitchen, and only their specific room, hallway, and kitchen and not to others. So I would say I'm pretty well-equipped to deal with computer programs.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a high level of contemplation (0.428) and interest (0.308), coupled with a sense of calmness (0.247) and satisfaction (0.230), suggesting they were thoughtfully engaged with the question while maintaining a composed and positive demeanor, which are generally desirable traits in an interview setting.",
        "feedback": "**Accuracy Percentage**: 75%\n\n**Feedback**:\n\n1. **Experience Relevance**: The candidate mentions their experience as a support engineer and software developer, which is relevant to the role's requirement for proficiency with computer systems. However, they could have provided more specific examples of software or systems they used in those roles, particularly those that are directly applicable to the receptionist position.\n\n2. **Specific Software Mention**: While the candidate lists Microsoft Word and Excel, they could enhance their answer by mentioning any other relevant software or systems they have used, especially those related to customer service or reception tasks. This would demonstrate a broader range of experience with computer systems.\n\n3. **Clarity on Current Role**: The candidate mentions using a software called Kinetics in their current receptionist role, but they could clarify what specific tasks they perform with it. Providing more detail about how they use this software would strengthen their response and show their hands-on experience with relevant systems.\n\n4. **General Proficiency Statement**: The candidate concludes by stating they are \"pretty well-equipped to deal with computer programs.\" This statement could be more impactful if they provided specific examples of challenges they faced with software and how they overcame them, showcasing their problem-solving skills and adaptability.\n\nOverall, while the candidate provides a solid overview of their experience, adding more specific examples and details about their proficiency with various software systems would improve the effectiveness of their answer."
