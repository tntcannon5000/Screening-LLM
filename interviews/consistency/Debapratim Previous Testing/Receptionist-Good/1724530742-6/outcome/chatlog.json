        "interviewer": "Hello! Thank you for taking the time to speak with me today about the Entry-Level Morning Receptionist (Part Time) position at our research institute. I'd like to ask you a few questions to learn more about your qualifications and interest in this role. Could you start by telling me why you're interested in this position?",
        "candidate": " Yes, sure. So I've been working as a part-time receptionist at the University of Kent for a year right now. And I think I'd be qualified in a customer-facing role such as this. Previous to this, I've also worked as a support engineer in big tech companies such as Ingram Micro and TCS, where I had to face customer queries from clients regarding whether the software is working or not. And I'll be graduating the University of Kent in two months, and after that I'm looking for a job in Cambridge, and this happens to be the perfect thing lined up for me.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a balanced mix of positive emotions, with notable levels of calmness (0.22), interest (0.17), and enthusiasm (0.11), while also displaying some awkwardness (0.09) and confusion (0.06), suggesting they were engaged but slightly nervous during the interview.",
        "feedback": "The accuracy of the answer provided is 85%.\n\nIn the response, the candidate effectively highlights their relevant experience as a part-time receptionist and their previous role as a support engineer, which demonstrates their customer service skills. However, there are a few areas where the answer could be improved:\n\n1. **Connection to the Role**: While the candidate mentions their experience, they could strengthen their response by explicitly connecting their skills and experiences to the specific requirements of the receptionist position, such as being friendly, patient, and having good communication skills. This would show a deeper understanding of what the role entails.\n\n2. **Future Aspirations**: The candidate states they are looking for a job in Cambridge and that this position is \"the perfect thing lined up for me.\" While this shows enthusiasm, it could be more impactful if they elaborated on why this specific role at the research institute aligns with their career goals or interests in the field.\n\n3. **Soft Skills**: The answer could benefit from mentioning soft skills that are essential for a receptionist role, such as being welcoming, patient, and able to handle difficult situations, which are highlighted in the additional context provided.\n\nOverall, the candidate has a solid foundation but could enhance their answer by making more explicit connections to the job requirements and demonstrating a deeper understanding of the role's expectations."

        "interviewer": "Thank you for sharing that background. It's great to hear about your relevant experience. Could you tell me more about your availability? This position requires opening reception at 8:30 AM and working until 12:45 PM, Monday to Friday. Would you be able to commit to these hours?",
        "candidate": " Yes, sure. After I graduate from university, I will have permission to work 40 hours a week. And apart from that, I am very punctual. Currently, my working hours are from 9 a.m. to 2 a.m. 2 p.m. My bad. And previously, when I worked as a tech support engineer, my working hours were from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Sometimes it extended from 9 a.m. to 10 p.m. depending on heavy workloads. And I was able to deliver to those times. And I think I will be able to deliver for the part-time receptionist role at Cambridge.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited strong determination (0.62) and enthusiasm (0.60), coupled with high levels of concentration (0.19) and contemplation (0.20), suggesting a focused and passionate approach to the interview question, while also displaying notable levels of excitement (0.30) and interest (0.32) that indicate genuine engagement with the topic at hand.",
        "feedback": "**Accuracy Score: 70%**\n\n**Feedback:**\n\n1. **Availability Misunderstanding**: The candidate mentions that they will have permission to work 40 hours a week after graduation. However, the position requires availability for specific hours (8:30 AM to 12:45 PM, Monday to Friday), which totals to approximately 22.5 hours per week. The candidate should have directly addressed their ability to commit to these specific hours rather than focusing on a general 40-hour work week after graduation.\n\n2. **Current Working Hours Confusion**: The candidate states their current working hours are from \"9 a.m. to 2 a.m. 2 p.m.\" This appears to be a transcription error, and it should be clarified as \"9 a.m. to 2 p.m.\" for accuracy. This confusion could lead to misunderstandings about their current availability.\n\n3. **Relevance to the Role**: While the candidate mentions their punctuality and previous work experience, they do not explicitly connect these attributes to the specific requirements of the receptionist role. They could enhance their response by emphasizing how their experience aligns with the responsibilities of a receptionist, such as managing schedules, greeting visitors, and handling phone calls.\n\n4. **Commitment to Part-Time Role**: The candidate states they \"think\" they will be able to deliver for the part-time receptionist role. This phrasing lacks confidence. A more assertive statement about their commitment to the part-time hours would strengthen their response.\n\nOverall, while the candidate provides relevant experience, they need to clarify their availability concerning the specific hours required for the position and express more confidence in their ability to meet those requirements."

        "interviewer": "I see, thank you for that information. This role requires excellent communication and interpersonal skills. Can you give me an example of how you've demonstrated these skills in your previous receptionist or customer service roles?",
        "candidate": " I'm sure. I think the most important customer service or speaking skills come into focus when the customer is agitated. So one such example would be double booking the same room for two different customers. This happened one time when I was at reception even though I was not responsible for that particular booking. So the customer was very angry at the situation and when they approached reception they wanted to get answers. However, I had to take the responsibility on myself and had to have a very apologetic tone when dealing with the customer and to kind of show them that this was an error with the booking system itself not with the reception. And eventually they understood and we were able to book a new room for them. And one such situation from my time as a support engineer would be when I initially joined the role I did not know the layouts of the entire application or the pitfalls of the application I was working on and I had a really high or tense call with a customer since their transactions were not processed at a specific date. I had to get help from my senior support staff and also convince them of the technical difficulties why they could not do and there was nothing that could be done at the moment and if they allowed us two days of time we would enable the transaction and that this would not happen in the future. And the customer was convinced and they continued to use our software from there on. So these are the two circumstances that come into mind when dealing with customers in a very efficient and responsible and apologetic way to cool them down.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a balanced and positive emotional state, characterized by high levels of calmness (0.38), satisfaction (0.36), and contentment (0.26), along with notable determination (0.30) and concentration (0.20), suggesting a composed and focused demeanor that would be well-suited for a successful interview.",
        "feedback": "**Accuracy Score: 80%**\n\n**Feedback:**\n\n1. **Handling Customer Anger**: The candidate provides a relevant example of dealing with an agitated customer due to a double booking. They effectively demonstrate their ability to remain calm, take responsibility, and communicate apologetically. However, they could enhance their response by incorporating specific phrases or techniques for de-escalating situations, as suggested in the additional context. For instance, using phrases like \"I completely understand the frustration you\u2019re feeling\" could further illustrate their communication skills.\n\n2. **Clarity in Examples**: The candidate shares two examples, one from their receptionist experience and another from their time as a support engineer. While both examples are relevant, the transition between them could be clearer. The candidate should ensure that each example distinctly highlights their communication and interpersonal skills, making it easier for the interviewer to follow their thought process.\n\n3. **Connection to Role Requirements**: While the candidate mentions their approach to handling difficult situations, they could strengthen their answer by explicitly connecting their experiences to the specific requirements of the receptionist role. For instance, they could emphasize how their skills in calming customers and resolving issues are directly applicable to the responsibilities of a receptionist.\n\n4. **Confidence in Resolution**: The candidate mentions that the customer was eventually convinced and continued to use the software. While this is a positive outcome, they could express more confidence in their ability to resolve customer issues effectively. Phrasing such as \"I was able to reassure the customer and provide a solution\" would convey a stronger sense of competence.\n\nOverall, the candidate demonstrates relevant experience and skills but could improve their response by incorporating specific customer service techniques and making clearer connections to the role's requirements."

        "interviewer": "Thank you for sharing those examples. One last question: this role requires proficiency with computer systems. Could you briefly describe your experience with various software or systems you've used in your previous roles?",
        "candidate": " I'm sure. I worked as a support engineer in Big Tech for one year. I also worked as a software developer for the last four years of my professional career. So I'm well-honed in programming skills such as Python, Java, using frameworks such as Django and Spring. I'm also well-honed in using Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, and in my current receptionist role, we use a software called Kinetics to book specific rooms and also configure fobs so that the customer has access to their room, hallway, and kitchen, and only their specific room, hallway, and kitchen and not to others. So I would say I'm pretty well-equipped to deal with computer programs.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a high level of contemplation (0.428) and interest (0.308), coupled with notable levels of calmness (0.247), satisfaction (0.230), and realization (0.209), suggesting a thoughtful and engaged approach to the interview question while maintaining a composed and positive demeanor.",
        "feedback": "**Accuracy Score: 75%**\n\n**Feedback:**\n\n1. **Relevance of Experience**: The candidate provides a solid overview of their experience with various software systems, including their roles as a support engineer and software developer. However, they could enhance their response by explicitly mentioning how their programming skills (Python, Java, Django, Spring) relate to the proficiency required for the receptionist role. While these skills are impressive, they may not directly align with the day-to-day tasks of a receptionist.\n\n2. **Specific Software Mentioned**: The candidate mentions using Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, and a software called Kinetics. While this is relevant, they could elaborate on their proficiency with these tools, such as specific tasks they performed or how they utilized these programs to improve efficiency or customer service. This would provide a clearer picture of their capabilities.\n\n3. **Clarity and Structure**: The response could benefit from clearer structure. The candidate jumps between different roles and experiences, which may make it harder for the interviewer to follow. A more organized approach, perhaps by discussing each role separately and highlighting relevant software skills for each, would improve clarity.\n\n4. **Confidence in Skills**: The candidate states, \"I would say I'm pretty well-equipped to deal with computer programs.\" This phrasing could be more assertive. A stronger statement, such as \"I am confident in my ability to effectively use various computer programs,\" would convey greater self-assurance in their skills.\n\nOverall, while the candidate demonstrates relevant experience and knowledge of software systems, they could improve their response by making clearer connections to the specific requirements of the receptionist role and providing more detail about their proficiency with the mentioned software."
