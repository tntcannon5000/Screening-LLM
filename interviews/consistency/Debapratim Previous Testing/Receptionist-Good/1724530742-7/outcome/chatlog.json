        "interviewer": "Hello! Thank you for taking the time to speak with me today about the Entry-Level Morning Receptionist (Part Time) position at our research institute. I'd like to ask you a few questions to learn more about your qualifications and interest in this role. Could you start by telling me why you're interested in this position?",
        "candidate": " Yes, sure. So I've been working as a part-time receptionist at the University of Kent for a year right now. And I think I'd be qualified in a customer-facing role such as this. Previous to this, I've also worked as a support engineer in big tech companies such as Ingram Micro and TCS, where I had to face customer queries from clients regarding whether the software is working or not. And I'll be graduating the University of Kent in two months, and after that I'm looking for a job in Cambridge, and this happens to be the perfect thing lined up for me.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a notably calm demeanor (0.22 calmness score) while showing significant interest (0.17) and enthusiasm (0.11), balanced with a moderate level of positive surprise (0.17) and joy (0.08), suggesting an engaged and positive attitude during the interview, though some awkwardness (0.09) and confusion (0.06) were also present, potentially indicating areas where they could improve their communication or understanding.",
        "feedback": "The accuracy of the answer provided is 85%.\n\nFeedback on inaccuracies:\n\n1. **Experience Relevance**: While the candidate mentions their experience as a part-time receptionist at the University of Kent, they could have elaborated more on specific skills or tasks they performed in that role that directly relate to the responsibilities of the Entry-Level Morning Receptionist position. This would strengthen their case for being qualified for the role.\n\n2. **Customer Service Skills**: The candidate references their previous role as a support engineer, which involves customer queries. However, they could have emphasized how this experience has equipped them with excellent customer service skills, which are crucial for a receptionist role. More specific examples of handling customer interactions would enhance their response.\n\n3. **Future Aspirations**: The candidate mentions looking for a job in Cambridge after graduation, which is relevant. However, they could have tied this aspiration more closely to the specific role they are applying for, explaining how this position aligns with their career goals and interests in the field of research or administration.\n\nOverall, the candidate has relevant experience but could improve their answer by providing more specific examples and connections to the role they are applying for."

        "interviewer": "Thank you for sharing that background. It's great to hear about your relevant experience. Could you tell me more about your availability? This position requires opening reception at 8:30 AM and working until 12:45 PM, Monday to Friday. Would you be able to commit to these hours?",
        "candidate": " Yes, sure. After I graduate from university, I will have permission to work 40 hours a week. And apart from that, I am very punctual. Currently, my working hours are from 9 a.m. to 2 a.m. 2 p.m. My bad. And previously, when I worked as a tech support engineer, my working hours were from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Sometimes it extended from 9 a.m. to 10 p.m. depending on heavy workloads. And I was able to deliver to those times. And I think I will be able to deliver for the part-time receptionist role at Cambridge.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited strong determination (0.62) and enthusiasm (0.60), coupled with high levels of concentration (0.19) and contemplation (0.20), suggesting a focused and passionate approach to the interview question, while also demonstrating significant interest (0.32) and excitement (0.30) in the topic, which are all positive indicators for a successful interview performance.",
        "feedback": "**Accuracy Percentage**: 70%\n\n**Feedback on Inaccuracies**:\n\n1. **Availability Clarification**: The candidate mentions that they will have permission to work 40 hours a week after graduation. However, this is not relevant to the immediate question about availability for the part-time receptionist position, which requires specific hours (8:30 AM to 12:45 PM, Monday to Friday). The candidate should have directly addressed their ability to commit to these specific hours instead of discussing future work permissions.\n\n2. **Current Working Hours**: The candidate states their current working hours as \"from 9 a.m. to 2 a.m. 2 p.m.\" This appears to be a transcription error, and it should be clarified as \"from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m.\" This confusion could lead to misunderstandings about their current availability.\n\n3. **Punctuality and Commitment**: While the candidate mentions being punctual, they could have provided more specific examples or anecdotes that demonstrate their reliability and commitment to previous roles. This would strengthen their case for being a suitable candidate for the receptionist position.\n\n4. **Relevance of Previous Experience**: The candidate references their experience as a tech support engineer and the flexibility of their working hours. However, they should have focused more on how this experience translates to the receptionist role, particularly in terms of customer service and communication skills, which are crucial for the position. \n\nOverall, while the candidate has relevant experience and expresses a willingness to work, they need to provide clearer and more focused responses regarding their availability and how their past experiences relate to the specific requirements of the receptionist role."

        "interviewer": "I see, thank you for that information. This role requires excellent communication and interpersonal skills. Can you give me an example of how you've demonstrated these skills in your previous receptionist or customer service roles?",
        "candidate": " I'm sure. I think the most important customer service or speaking skills come into focus when the customer is agitated. So one such example would be double booking the same room for two different customers. This happened one time when I was at reception even though I was not responsible for that particular booking. So the customer was very angry at the situation and when they approached reception they wanted to get answers. However, I had to take the responsibility on myself and had to have a very apologetic tone when dealing with the customer and to kind of show them that this was an error with the booking system itself not with the reception. And eventually they understood and we were able to book a new room for them. And one such situation from my time as a support engineer would be when I initially joined the role I did not know the layouts of the entire application or the pitfalls of the application I was working on and I had a really high or tense call with a customer since their transactions were not processed at a specific date. I had to get help from my senior support staff and also convince them of the technical difficulties why they could not do and there was nothing that could be done at the moment and if they allowed us two days of time we would enable the transaction and that this would not happen in the future. And the customer was convinced and they continued to use our software from there on. So these are the two circumstances that come into mind when dealing with customers in a very efficient and responsible and apologetic way to cool them down.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a balanced mix of positive emotions and professional demeanor, with high levels of calmness (0.38), contentment (0.26), and satisfaction (0.36), coupled with strong indicators of concentration (0.20) and determination (0.30), suggesting a composed and focused approach to the interview question.",
        "feedback": "**Accuracy Percentage**: 80%\n\n**Feedback on Inaccuracies**:\n\n1. **Example Relevance**: The candidate provides two examples of handling difficult customer situations, which is good. However, the first example about double booking could have been more concise. While it demonstrates communication and interpersonal skills, it could have focused more on the specific actions taken to resolve the issue and how they communicated with the customer to de-escalate the situation.\n\n2. **Clarity and Structure**: The response is somewhat lengthy and could benefit from clearer structure. Breaking down the examples into distinct parts (situation, action, result) would enhance clarity and make it easier for the interviewer to follow the candidate's thought process.\n\n3. **Emotional Intelligence**: While the candidate mentions using an apologetic tone, they could have elaborated on how they empathized with the customers' feelings. Incorporating phrases that show understanding and sympathy, as suggested in the additional context, would strengthen their response and demonstrate emotional intelligence.\n\n4. **Connection to Role**: The candidate could have explicitly connected their experiences to the specific skills required for the receptionist role, such as managing front desk operations, multitasking, and maintaining a calm demeanor in a busy environment. This would help reinforce their suitability for the position.\n\nOverall, the candidate demonstrates relevant experience and skills but could improve their answer by providing more focused examples, enhancing clarity, and explicitly connecting their experiences to the requirements of the receptionist role."

        "interviewer": "Thank you for sharing those examples. One last question: this role requires proficiency with computer systems. Could you briefly describe your experience with various software or systems you've used in your previous roles?",
        "candidate": " I'm sure. I worked as a support engineer in Big Tech for one year. I also worked as a software developer for the last four years of my professional career. So I'm well-honed in programming skills such as Python, Java, using frameworks such as Django and Spring. I'm also well-honed in using Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, and in my current receptionist role, we use a software called Kinetics to book specific rooms and also configure fobs so that the customer has access to their room, hallway, and kitchen, and only their specific room, hallway, and kitchen and not to others. So I would say I'm pretty well-equipped to deal with computer programs.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a high level of contemplation (0.43) and interest (0.31), coupled with a sense of calmness (0.25) and satisfaction (0.23), suggesting they were thoughtfully engaged in the conversation while maintaining a composed and positive demeanor, which are generally favorable traits in an interview setting.",
        "feedback": "**Accuracy Percentage**: 75%\n\n**Feedback on Inaccuracies**:\n\n1. **Relevance of Experience**: The candidate mentions their experience as a support engineer and software developer, which is relevant to the role requiring proficiency with computer systems. However, they could have provided more specific examples of software or systems they used in those roles, particularly those that are directly applicable to the receptionist position. This would strengthen their response by demonstrating a broader range of technical skills.\n\n2. **Specific Software Mention**: While the candidate mentions using Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, and Kinetics, they could have elaborated on their proficiency with these tools. For instance, detailing specific tasks they accomplished using Excel (like data management or reporting) would provide a clearer picture of their capabilities.\n\n3. **Connection to Role Requirements**: The candidate states they are \"well-equipped to deal with computer programs,\" but this statement could be more impactful if they explicitly connected their skills to the specific requirements of the receptionist role. For example, they could mention how their technical background would help them quickly learn any new software used in the reception area.\n\n4. **Clarity and Structure**: The response is somewhat lengthy and could benefit from clearer structure. Organizing the answer into distinct sections (such as past roles, specific software used, and how these experiences relate to the current position) would enhance clarity and make it easier for the interviewer to follow the candidate's thought process.\n\nOverall, while the candidate demonstrates relevant experience and skills, they could improve their answer by providing more focused examples, enhancing clarity, and explicitly connecting their experiences to the requirements of the receptionist role."
