        "interviewer": "Hello! Thank you for taking the time to speak with me today about the Entry-Level Morning Receptionist (Part Time) position at our research institute. I'd like to ask you a few questions to learn more about your qualifications and interest in this role. Could you start by telling me why you're interested in this position?",
        "candidate": " Yes, sure. So I've been working as a part-time receptionist at the University of Kent for a year right now. And I think I'd be qualified in a customer-facing role such as this. Previous to this, I've also worked as a support engineer in big tech companies such as Ingram Micro and TCS, where I had to face customer queries from clients regarding whether the software is working or not. And I'll be graduating the University of Kent in two months, and after that I'm looking for a job in Cambridge, and this happens to be the perfect thing lined up for me.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a balanced emotional state with notable levels of calmness (0.22), interest (0.17), and positive surprise (0.17), while also displaying moderate enthusiasm (0.11) and amusement (0.09), suggesting they were engaged and comfortable during the interview, though slight awkwardness (0.09) and confusion (0.06) were present, potentially indicating some nervousness or uncertainty about certain aspects of the conversation.",
        "feedback": "**Accuracy Score: 85%**\n\n**Feedback:**\n\n1. **Experience Relevance**: The candidate mentions working as a part-time receptionist at the University of Kent, which is relevant experience for the role. However, they could have elaborated more on specific skills or tasks they performed in that role that directly relate to the responsibilities of a receptionist, such as managing phone calls, scheduling appointments, or handling customer inquiries.\n\n2. **Soft Skills**: While the candidate has experience in customer-facing roles, they did not explicitly mention soft skills such as empathy, patience, or communication skills, which are crucial for a receptionist position. Highlighting these traits would strengthen their response.\n\n3. **Future Aspirations**: The candidate states they are looking for a job in Cambridge after graduation, which is relevant. However, they could have emphasized how this specific position aligns with their career goals or interests in the research field, which would demonstrate a stronger connection to the role.\n\n4. **Clarity and Structure**: The response could benefit from clearer structure. For instance, separating their experience, skills, and future aspirations into distinct points would make it easier for the interviewer to follow their reasoning.\n\nOverall, the candidate provided a solid foundation for their interest in the position but could enhance their answer by focusing more on relevant skills and experiences that align with the specific requirements of the receptionist role."

        "interviewer": "Thank you for sharing that background. It's great to hear about your relevant experience. Could you tell me more about your availability? This position requires opening reception at 8:30 AM and working until 12:45 PM, Monday to Friday. Would you be able to commit to these hours?",
        "candidate": " Yes, sure. After I graduate from university, I will have permission to work 40 hours a week. And apart from that, I am very punctual. Currently, my working hours are from 9 a.m. to 2 a.m. 2 p.m. My bad. And previously, when I worked as a tech support engineer, my working hours were from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Sometimes it extended from 9 a.m. to 10 p.m. depending on heavy workloads. And I was able to deliver to those times. And I think I will be able to deliver for the part-time receptionist role at Cambridge.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a strong sense of determination (0.62) and enthusiasm (0.60), coupled with a high level of concentration (0.19) and interest (0.32), suggesting they were engaged and motivated during the interview, while also displaying a positive emotional state as indicated by the high sentiment scores in the 7-8 range.",
        "feedback": "**Accuracy Score: 70%**\n\n**Feedback:**\n\n1. **Availability Misunderstanding**: The candidate states they will have permission to work 40 hours a week after graduation. However, the position requires availability for specific hours (8:30 AM to 12:45 PM, Monday to Friday), which is part-time and does not align with a full-time commitment. The candidate should have directly addressed their ability to commit to the specified hours rather than focusing on their future full-time work eligibility.\n\n2. **Current Working Hours**: The candidate mentions their current working hours as \"from 9 a.m. to 2 a.m. 2 p.m.\" This appears to be a transcription error, and it should be clarified that they meant to say \"from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m.\" This confusion could lead to misunderstandings about their current availability.\n\n3. **Relevance of Past Experience**: While the candidate provides information about their previous roles, they do not explicitly connect this experience to the specific requirements of the receptionist position. They should have highlighted how their past roles prepared them for the responsibilities of a receptionist, such as managing front desk duties or handling customer inquiries.\n\n4. **Punctuality Mention**: The candidate mentions being punctual, which is a positive trait for a receptionist. However, they could have elaborated on how this punctuality has been demonstrated in their previous roles, which would strengthen their response.\n\nOverall, the candidate's answer lacks a direct response to the availability question and does not clearly connect their experience to the specific requirements of the receptionist role."

        "interviewer": "I see, thank you for that information. This role requires excellent communication and interpersonal skills. Can you give me an example of how you've demonstrated these skills in your previous receptionist or customer service roles?",
        "candidate": " I'm sure. I think the most important customer service or speaking skills come into focus when the customer is agitated. So one such example would be double booking the same room for two different customers. This happened one time when I was at reception even though I was not responsible for that particular booking. So the customer was very angry at the situation and when they approached reception they wanted to get answers. However, I had to take the responsibility on myself and had to have a very apologetic tone when dealing with the customer and to kind of show them that this was an error with the booking system itself not with the reception. And eventually they understood and we were able to book a new room for them. And one such situation from my time as a support engineer would be when I initially joined the role I did not know the layouts of the entire application or the pitfalls of the application I was working on and I had a really high or tense call with a customer since their transactions were not processed at a specific date. I had to get help from my senior support staff and also convince them of the technical difficulties why they could not do and there was nothing that could be done at the moment and if they allowed us two days of time we would enable the transaction and that this would not happen in the future. And the customer was convinced and they continued to use our software from there on. So these are the two circumstances that come into mind when dealing with customers in a very efficient and responsible and apologetic way to cool them down.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a balanced mix of positive emotions and professional demeanor, with notably high levels of calmness (0.38), satisfaction (0.36), determination (0.30), and contentment (0.26), alongside strong indicators of concentration (0.20) and contemplation (0.24), suggesting a composed and thoughtful approach to the interview question that would likely be viewed favorably in a professional setting.",
        "feedback": "**Accuracy Score: 75%**\n\n**Feedback:**\n\n1. **Example Relevance**: The candidate provided two examples of handling difficult customer situations, which is relevant to demonstrating communication and interpersonal skills. However, the first example about double booking could have been more concise and focused on the specific skills used, such as active listening and empathy, rather than detailing the situation extensively.\n\n2. **Clarity of Communication**: While the candidate described their approach to handling angry customers, the explanation was somewhat convoluted. They could have structured their response more clearly by separating the two examples and explicitly stating the skills demonstrated in each situation.\n\n3. **Use of Apologetic Tone**: The candidate mentioned using an apologetic tone, which aligns with best practices for dealing with angry customers. However, they could have explicitly referenced the importance of acknowledging the customer's feelings and providing reassurance, as suggested in the additional context provided.\n\n4. **Connection to Role**: The candidate did not explicitly connect their experiences to the specific requirements of the receptionist role. They should have highlighted how these experiences would help them excel in a receptionist position, particularly in managing front desk duties and interacting with a diverse range of customers.\n\n5. **Technical Difficulties**: In the second example, the candidate mentioned technical difficulties but did not elaborate on how they communicated these issues to the customer. Providing more detail on how they explained the situation and reassured the customer would strengthen their response.\n\nOverall, the candidate's answer demonstrates relevant experience but could benefit from clearer communication and a stronger connection to the specific skills required for the receptionist role."

        "interviewer": "Thank you for sharing those examples. One last question: this role requires proficiency with computer systems. Could you briefly describe your experience with various software or systems you've used in your previous roles?",
        "candidate": " I'm sure. I worked as a support engineer in Big Tech for one year. I also worked as a software developer for the last four years of my professional career. So I'm well-honed in programming skills such as Python, Java, using frameworks such as Django and Spring. I'm also well-honed in using Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, and in my current receptionist role, we use a software called Kinetics to book specific rooms and also configure fobs so that the customer has access to their room, hallway, and kitchen, and only their specific room, hallway, and kitchen and not to others. So I would say I'm pretty well-equipped to deal with computer programs.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a high level of contemplation (0.428) and interest (0.308), coupled with a sense of calmness (0.247) and satisfaction (0.230), suggesting they were thoughtfully engaged with the question while maintaining a composed and positive demeanor appropriate for an interview setting.",
        "feedback": "**Accuracy Score: 80%**\n\n**Feedback:**\n\n1. **Experience Relevance**: The candidate provides a solid overview of their experience with various software systems, including programming languages and frameworks, which is relevant to the role. However, they could have emphasized more on their experience with software systems specifically related to receptionist duties or customer service, such as scheduling or booking systems.\n\n2. **Specific Software Mention**: The candidate mentions using Kinetics for booking rooms and configuring access, which is a good example. However, they could have elaborated on how they utilized this software effectively in their role, such as any specific features they used or challenges they overcame while using it.\n\n3. **Clarity and Structure**: The response could benefit from clearer structure. The candidate jumps between different roles and experiences, which may make it harder for the interviewer to follow. Organizing their answer by role or type of software used would enhance clarity.\n\n4. **Technical Skills**: While the candidate lists programming languages and frameworks, they do not connect these skills to the receptionist role. They should have highlighted how their technical background could be an asset in a receptionist position, such as troubleshooting software issues or improving processes.\n\n5. **Generalization of Skills**: The candidate concludes by stating they are \"pretty well-equipped to deal with computer programs.\" This statement is somewhat vague. Providing specific examples of how they have successfully dealt with software issues or learned new systems quickly would strengthen their response. \n\nOverall, the candidate demonstrates relevant experience and skills but could improve their answer by focusing more on the specific software and systems related to the receptionist role and providing clearer examples of their proficiency."
