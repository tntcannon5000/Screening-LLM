        "interviewer": "Hello! Thank you for taking the time to speak with me today about the Entry-Level Morning Receptionist (Part Time) position at our research institute. I'd like to ask you a few questions to learn more about your qualifications and interest in this role. Could you start by telling me why you're interested in this position?",
        "candidate": " Yes, sure. So I've been working as a part-time receptionist at the University of Kent for a year right now. And I think I'd be qualified in a customer-facing role such as this. Previous to this, I've also worked as a support engineer in big tech companies such as Ingram Micro and TCS, where I had to face customer queries from clients regarding whether the software is working or not. And I'll be graduating the University of Kent in two months, and after that I'm looking for a job in Cambridge, and this happens to be the perfect thing lined up for me.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a notable level of calmness (0.22) and interest (0.17), along with moderate levels of enthusiasm (0.11) and positive surprise (0.17), indicating an engaged and composed demeanor during the interview, while also displaying some signs of awkwardness (0.09) and confusion (0.06) which could potentially be areas for improvement in future interactions.",
        "feedback": "The accuracy of the answer provided is 85%.\n\nIn the response, the candidate effectively highlights their relevant experience as a part-time receptionist and their previous role as a support engineer, which demonstrates their customer service skills. However, there are a few areas where the answer could be improved:\n\n1. **Connection to the Role**: While the candidate mentions their experience, they could strengthen their response by explicitly connecting their skills and experiences to the specific requirements of the receptionist position, such as being friendly, patient, and having good communication skills. This would show a deeper understanding of what the role entails.\n\n2. **Future Aspirations**: The candidate states they are looking for a job in Cambridge after graduation, which is relevant. However, they could enhance their answer by expressing how this specific position aligns with their career goals or interests in the research field, which would demonstrate a stronger motivation for applying.\n\n3. **Clarity and Structure**: The response could benefit from clearer structure. For instance, separating their current role, previous experience, and future aspirations into distinct points would make it easier for the interviewer to follow their narrative.\n\nOverall, the candidate has relevant experience and a clear interest in the position, but they could improve their answer by making stronger connections to the role's requirements and enhancing the clarity of their response."

        "interviewer": "Thank you for sharing that background. It's great to hear about your relevant experience. Could you tell me more about your availability? This position requires opening reception at 8:30 AM and working until 12:45 PM, Monday to Friday. Would you be able to commit to these hours?",
        "candidate": " Yes, sure. After I graduate from university, I will have permission to work 40 hours a week. And apart from that, I am very punctual. Currently, my working hours are from 9 a.m. to 2 a.m. 2 p.m. My bad. And previously, when I worked as a tech support engineer, my working hours were from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Sometimes it extended from 9 a.m. to 10 p.m. depending on heavy workloads. And I was able to deliver to those times. And I think I will be able to deliver for the part-time receptionist role at Cambridge.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited strong determination (0.62) and enthusiasm (0.60), coupled with a high level of concentration (0.19) and interest (0.32), suggesting they were engaged and motivated during the interview, while also displaying a positive emotional state as indicated by the high sentiment scores in the 7-8 range.",
        "feedback": "**Accuracy Percentage**: 70%\n\n**Feedback**:\n\n1. **Availability Misalignment**: The candidate states they will have permission to work 40 hours a week after graduation. However, based on the context provided regarding student visa restrictions, full-time students are only allowed to work a maximum of 20 hours per week during term time. This discrepancy indicates a misunderstanding of the working conditions associated with their student visa, which could lead to issues with compliance.\n\n2. **Commitment to Required Hours**: The candidate does not explicitly confirm their ability to commit to the specific hours required for the receptionist position (8:30 AM to 12:45 PM, Monday to Friday). While they mention being punctual and their previous working hours, they should directly address whether they can meet the specific schedule outlined in the question.\n\n3. **Clarity on Current Working Hours**: The candidate's current working hours are mentioned as \"from 9 a.m. to 2 a.m. 2 p.m.\" This appears to be a transcription error, and it should be clarified as \"from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m.\" for better understanding. However, this does not affect the overall accuracy score as it is a transcription issue.\n\n4. **Relevance of Previous Experience**: While the candidate mentions their experience as a tech support engineer, they could strengthen their response by explicitly relating how this experience has prepared them for the receptionist role, particularly in terms of customer service and communication skills.\n\nOverall, the candidate has relevant experience and expresses a willingness to work, but they need to clarify their understanding of the working restrictions and directly address their availability for the specific hours required for the position."

        "interviewer": "I see, thank you for that information. This role requires excellent communication and interpersonal skills. Can you give me an example of how you've demonstrated these skills in your previous receptionist or customer service roles?",
        "candidate": " I'm sure. I think the most important customer service or speaking skills come into focus when the customer is agitated. So one such example would be double booking the same room for two different customers. This happened one time when I was at reception even though I was not responsible for that particular booking. So the customer was very angry at the situation and when they approached reception they wanted to get answers. However, I had to take the responsibility on myself and had to have a very apologetic tone when dealing with the customer and to kind of show them that this was an error with the booking system itself not with the reception. And eventually they understood and we were able to book a new room for them. And one such situation from my time as a support engineer would be when I initially joined the role I did not know the layouts of the entire application or the pitfalls of the application I was working on and I had a really high or tense call with a customer since their transactions were not processed at a specific date. I had to get help from my senior support staff and also convince them of the technical difficulties why they could not do and there was nothing that could be done at the moment and if they allowed us two days of time we would enable the transaction and that this would not happen in the future. And the customer was convinced and they continued to use our software from there on. So these are the two circumstances that come into mind when dealing with customers in a very efficient and responsible and apologetic way to cool them down.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a balanced emotional state characterized by high levels of calmness (0.38), contentment (0.26), and satisfaction (0.36), coupled with strong indicators of concentration (0.20) and contemplation (0.24), suggesting a composed and thoughtful approach to the interview question while maintaining a positive and determined (0.30) attitude.",
        "feedback": "**Accuracy Percentage**: 80%\n\n**Feedback**:\n\n1. **Handling Customer Issues**: The candidate provides a relevant example of dealing with an agitated customer due to a double booking. They demonstrate effective communication skills by taking responsibility, using an apologetic tone, and clarifying the situation. This aligns well with the requirement for excellent communication and interpersonal skills.\n\n2. **Second Example Clarity**: The second example regarding their experience as a support engineer is somewhat less clear. While the candidate describes a tense situation, they could improve the clarity of their explanation. Specifically, they should focus on how they communicated with the customer to resolve the issue, emphasizing their interpersonal skills more explicitly.\n\n3. **Connection to Role**: The candidate could strengthen their response by explicitly connecting their experiences to the specific skills required for the receptionist role. For instance, they could mention how their ability to remain calm and empathetic in stressful situations is directly applicable to the receptionist position.\n\n4. **Use of Customer Service Phrases**: The candidate's response could benefit from incorporating specific customer service phrases that are effective in calming down angry customers, as mentioned in the additional context. This would demonstrate their knowledge of best practices in customer service.\n\nOverall, the candidate provides relevant examples that showcase their communication and interpersonal skills, but they could enhance their response by improving clarity and making stronger connections to the specific requirements of the receptionist role."

        "interviewer": "Thank you for sharing those examples. One last question: this role requires proficiency with computer systems. Could you briefly describe your experience with various software or systems you've used in your previous roles?",
        "candidate": " I'm sure. I worked as a support engineer in Big Tech for one year. I also worked as a software developer for the last four years of my professional career. So I'm well-honed in programming skills such as Python, Java, using frameworks such as Django and Spring. I'm also well-honed in using Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, and in my current receptionist role, we use a software called Kinetics to book specific rooms and also configure fobs so that the customer has access to their room, hallway, and kitchen, and only their specific room, hallway, and kitchen and not to others. So I would say I'm pretty well-equipped to deal with computer programs.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a high level of contemplation (0.43) and interest (0.31), coupled with notable levels of calmness (0.25), satisfaction (0.23), and realization (0.21), suggesting a thoughtful and engaged approach to the interview question with a balanced emotional state conducive to professional discourse.",
        "feedback": "**Accuracy Percentage**: 75%\n\n**Feedback**:\n\n1. **Experience Relevance**: The candidate mentions their experience as a support engineer and software developer, which is relevant to the role's requirement for proficiency with computer systems. However, they could enhance their response by providing more specific examples of software or systems they have used in those roles, particularly those that are directly applicable to the receptionist position.\n\n2. **Specific Software Mention**: While the candidate lists Microsoft Word and Excel, they could strengthen their answer by including any other relevant software or systems they have used, especially those related to customer service or reception tasks. This would provide a clearer picture of their proficiency with various computer systems.\n\n3. **Clarity on Current Role**: The candidate mentions using a software called Kinetics in their current receptionist role, but they could elaborate on how they use it and any specific features they are proficient in. This would demonstrate their hands-on experience with relevant software.\n\n4. **Generalization of Skills**: The candidate states they are \"pretty well-equipped to deal with computer programs,\" which is somewhat vague. They could improve their response by specifying particular skills or competencies they possess, such as troubleshooting, data entry, or managing bookings, which would provide a more concrete understanding of their capabilities.\n\nOverall, while the candidate provides a good overview of their experience, they could improve their answer by being more specific about the software and systems they have used and how those experiences relate to the requirements of the receptionist role."
