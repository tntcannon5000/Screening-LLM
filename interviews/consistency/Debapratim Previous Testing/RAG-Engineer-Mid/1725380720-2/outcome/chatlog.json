        "candidate": " Um, sure. Currently I'm in charge of programming fobs to take guests, sorry, currently I'm in charge of programming fobs to allow guests to have access to specific rooms.

        "feedback": "The accuracy of the answer provided is 75%.\n\nInaccuracies and feedback:\n\n1. **Specific Duties**: The candidate mentions programming fobs for guest access and connecting guests with housekeeping. While these tasks are relevant to a receptionist role, they do not fully encompass the range of responsibilities typically expected of a receptionist, such as greeting guests, managing reservations, or handling inquiries. It would be beneficial for the candidate to elaborate on additional duties that align more closely with the expectations for the Part-Time Receptionist position at the University of Edinburgh.\n\n2. **Guest Interaction**: The candidate states they connect guests with housekeeping for issues like shortages of bed sheets and fans. While this shows some level of customer service, it would strengthen the response to include more direct interactions with guests, such as greeting them, answering their questions, or providing information about the facility. This would demonstrate a broader range of customer service skills.\n\n3. **Problem-Solving Skills**: The candidate mentions attending to guest problems, but does not provide specific examples of how they resolved issues or ensured guest satisfaction. Including a brief example of a situation where they successfully addressed a guest's concern would enhance the response and showcase their problem-solving abilities.\n\nOverall, while the candidate's answer provides some relevant information about their current role, it could be improved by offering a more comprehensive view of their responsibilities and skills that directly relate to the Part-Time Receptionist position at the University of Edinburgh."

        "interviewer": "Thank you for sharing that information. It sounds like you have relevant experience with guest services and access management.

        "candidate": " Sure, so there was a case of double booking where I was left to attend to the customer even though I did not book them and they were pretty angry when they got to their room and found someone else in their room and the best I could do was calm them down and explain to them that this was a fault of the system and not any particular individual and then I had to contact conference in charge of bookings to get them a separate room. Yes, so this is how I handled it.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a high level of concentration (0.72) and determination (0.28), along with moderate levels of interest (0.19), contemplation (0.17), and satisfaction (0.16), suggesting they were deeply engaged and thoughtful in their answer while maintaining a generally positive and focused demeanor.",
        "feedback": "**Accuracy Score: 70%**\n\n**Inaccuracies and Feedback:**\n\n1. **Handling of the Situation**: The candidate describes a double booking scenario but does not provide a clear resolution process. While they mention calming the customer and explaining the situation, they could enhance their response by detailing how they ensured the guest's satisfaction, such as offering alternatives or additional assistance. This would demonstrate stronger problem-solving skills and customer service.\n\n2. **Communication Skills**: The candidate mentions explaining the fault of the system but does not elaborate on how they communicated effectively with the upset guest. Providing an example of specific phrases or techniques used to de-escalate the situation would better illustrate their communication skills, which are essential for the role.\n\n3. **Follow-Up Actions**: The candidate states they contacted the conference in charge of bookings to get a separate room for the guest. However, they do not mention any follow-up with the guest to ensure they were satisfied with the new arrangement or if there were any additional needs. Including this would show a commitment to customer service and thoroughness in their role.\n\nOverall, while the candidate's answer addresses the question, it could be improved by providing more detail on their communication techniques, resolution strategies, and follow-up actions to enhance the portrayal of their skills in handling challenging situations."
