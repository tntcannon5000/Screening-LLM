        "interviewer": "That's great to hear about your current experience as a part-time receptionist. Could you tell me more about your specific duties in your current role and how they might relate to this position at the University of Edinburgh?",
        "candidate": " Um, sure. Currently I'm in charge of programming fobs to take guests, sorry, currently I'm in charge of programming fobs to allow guests to have access to specific rooms.

        "feedback": "The accuracy of the answer provided is 75%.\n\nIn the response, the candidate describes their current duties, such as programming fobs for guest access and connecting guests with housekeeping for various issues. This information is relevant to the role of a receptionist and demonstrates their experience in handling guest-related tasks.\n\nHowever, the answer could be improved in the following areas:\n\n1. **Clarity and Structure**: The candidate's response begins with a filler (\"Um, sure\") and includes a repeated phrase (\"sorry, currently I'm in charge of programming fobs\"). This could be streamlined for better clarity and professionalism.\n\n2. **Connection to the University of Edinburgh**: While the candidate outlines their current responsibilities, they do not explicitly relate these duties to the position at the University of Edinburgh. Providing specific examples of how their experience aligns with the expectations of the new role would strengthen their answer.\n\n3. **Detail on Problem-Solving**: The candidate mentions connecting guests with housekeeping for issues but could elaborate on how they handle these situations, showcasing their problem-solving skills and customer service abilities.\n\nOverall, while the candidate provides relevant information about their current role, enhancing the clarity of their response and making explicit connections to the new position would improve the effectiveness of their answer."

For this role at the University of Edinburgh, strong communication skills are essential. Can you give me an example of how you've handled a challenging communication situation with a visitor or staff member in your current position?",
        "candidate": " Sure, so there was a case of double booking where I was left to attend to the customer even though I did not book them and they were pretty angry when they got to their room and found someone else in their room and the best I could do was calm them down and explain to them that this was a fault of the system and not any particular individual and then I had to contact conference in charge of bookings to get them a separate room. Yes, so this is how I handled it.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a high level of concentration (0.646) and determination (0.297), coupled with moderate levels of contemplation (0.176) and interest (0.174), suggesting a focused and engaged approach to the interview question, while maintaining a generally neutral emotional state as indicated by the dominant sentiment score in the middle range (0.895 for level 5).",
        "feedback": "**Accuracy Score: 80%**\n\n**Feedback:**\n\n1. **Clarity and Structure**: The candidate's response could benefit from improved clarity and structure.
