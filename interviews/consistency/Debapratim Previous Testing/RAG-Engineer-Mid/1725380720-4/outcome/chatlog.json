I'd like to ask you a few questions to learn more about your qualifications and interest in this role. Could you start by telling me what attracted you to this position?",
        "candidate": " I'm sure. I currently work as a part-time receptionist at the University of Kent and I'm looking to transition into... I mean, I'm looking to move to Edinburgh and this would be a good fit for me since I already have the experience.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a high level of interest (0.34) and enthusiasm (0.20), along with notable levels of excitement (0.15) and joy (0.13), while maintaining a sense of calmness (0.17), indicating a positive and engaged demeanor during the interview, although a slight degree of awkwardness (0.10) and confusion (0.07) was also present, potentially suggesting some nervousness or uncertainty about certain aspects of the discussion.",
        "feedback": "The accuracy of the answer provided is 80%.\n\nInaccuracies and feedback:\n\n1. **Current Position**: The candidate mentions they are currently working as a part-time receptionist at the University of Kent. While this is relevant experience, the answer could have been more focused on why they are specifically attracted to the University of Edinburgh position, rather than just stating their current job. This could have included aspects such as the working environment, the specific responsibilities of the role, or the opportunity to work in a new location.\n\n2. **Transition Motivation**: The candidate states they are looking to \"transition into\" the position, which is somewhat vague. It would have been beneficial for them to elaborate on what specifically about the University of Edinburgh or the role itself appeals to them beyond just the location change.\n\nOverall, while the candidate provided relevant experience, they could enhance their response by articulating their motivations and interests in the specific role at the University of Edinburgh more clearly."

        "interviewer": "That's great to hear about your current experience as a part-time receptionist. Could you tell me more about your specific duties in your current role and how they might relate to this position at the University of Edinburgh?",
        "candidate": " Um, sure. Currently I'm in charge of programming fobs to take guests, sorry, currently I'm in charge of programming fobs to allow guests to have access to specific rooms. I also have to connect guests with housekeeping if they have any problem or to attend any other problems they might have, such as shortage of bed sheets, fans, air trials, etc.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited exceptionally high levels of concentration (0.97) and determination (0.54), along with notable interest (0.28), satisfaction (0.22), and enthusiasm (0.19), suggesting a focused and engaged demeanor that would be highly favorable in an interview setting, while maintaining a balanced emotional state with minimal negative or toxic indicators.",
        "feedback": "The accuracy of the answer provided is 75%.\n\nInaccuracies and feedback:\n\n1. **Specific Duties**: The candidate mentions programming fobs for guest access and connecting guests with housekeeping for various issues. While these duties are relevant to a receptionist role, the answer could have been more comprehensive by including additional responsibilities that are typically expected of a receptionist, such as managing phone calls, greeting guests, or handling inquiries. This would have better illustrated their overall experience and how it aligns with the position at the University of Edinburgh.\n\n2. **Relevance to the University of Edinburgh**: The candidate does not explicitly connect their current duties to how they would be applicable or beneficial in the context of the University of Edinburgh. It would have strengthened their response to mention how their experience with guest access and problem-solving could translate into providing excellent service in a university setting.\n\n3. **Clarity and Structure**: The answer lacks clarity and structure, particularly with the phrase \"sorry, currently I'm in charge of programming fobs.\" This could be seen as unprofessional in an interview context. A more polished response would enhance the candidate's presentation.\n\nOverall, while the candidate provided relevant information about their current role, they could improve their response by elaborating on their duties, making clearer connections to the new position, and presenting their answer in a more structured manner."

        "interviewer": "Thank you for sharing that information. It sounds like you have relevant experience with guest services and access management. For this role at the University of Edinburgh, strong communication skills are essential. Can you give me an example of how you've handled a challenging communication situation with a visitor or staff member in your current position?",
        "candidate": " Sure, so there was a case of double booking where I was left to attend to the customer even though I did not book them and they were pretty angry when they got to their room and found someone else in their room and the best I could do was calm them down and explain to them that this was a fault of the system and not any particular individual and then I had to contact conference in charge of bookings to get them a separate room. Yes, so this is how I handled it.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a high level of concentration (0.70) and determination (0.33), coupled with moderate levels of interest (0.25), contemplation (0.17), and enthusiasm (0.15), suggesting a focused and engaged demeanor that would be highly favorable in an interview setting.",
        "feedback": "**Accuracy Score**: 70%\n\n**Inaccuracies and Feedback**:\n\n1. **Handling of the Situation**: The candidate mentions that they had to contact the conference in charge of bookings to get the customer a separate room. While this is a necessary step, the answer could have been improved by detailing how they communicated this to the guest and what specific steps they took to ensure the guest felt heard and valued during the process. This would demonstrate stronger communication skills.\n\n2. **Calming the Customer**: The candidate states they \"calmed them down,\" but does not provide specific techniques or phrases they used to de-escalate the situation. Including this information would have illustrated their communication skills more effectively and shown their ability to handle difficult situations.\n\n3. **System Fault Explanation**: The candidate mentions explaining that the double booking was a fault of the system and not an individual. While this is important, it would have been beneficial to emphasize empathy towards the guest's frustration. Acknowledging the guest's feelings and expressing understanding could enhance the response and demonstrate strong interpersonal skills.\n\n4. **Resolution Process**: The answer lacks detail on how the candidate ensured the guest's needs were met after the initial issue. For example, did they follow up with the guest after providing a new room? Did they offer any additional assistance or compensation? Providing this information would show a commitment to customer service and thoroughness in resolving issues.\n\nOverall, while the candidate provided a relevant example of handling a challenging communication situation, they could enhance their response by elaborating on their communication techniques, demonstrating empathy, and detailing the resolution process more thoroughly."
