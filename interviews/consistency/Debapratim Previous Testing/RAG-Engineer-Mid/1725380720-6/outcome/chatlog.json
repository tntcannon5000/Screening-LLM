        "candidate": " I'm sure. I currently work as a part-time receptionist at the University of Kent and I'm looking to transition into... I mean, I'm looking to move to Edinburgh and this would be a good fit for me since I already have the experience.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a high level of confusion (0.295) and boredom (0.150), coupled with moderate levels of calmness (0.098) and awkwardness (0.080), suggesting they may have struggled to understand or engage with the question while attempting to maintain composure during the interview.",
        "feedback": "The accuracy of the answer provided is 70%.\n\nFeedback:\n1. The candidate mentions their current role as a part-time receptionist at the University of Kent, which is relevant experience. However, they do not explicitly state what specifically attracted them to the position at the University of Edinburgh beyond the fact that it would be a good fit due to their experience. It would have been beneficial for them to elaborate on their interest in the specific role or the university itself.\n2. The phrase \"I'm looking to transition into... I mean, I'm looking to move to Edinburgh\" suggests some uncertainty or hesitation.

A more confident and direct statement about their motivation for moving and applying would strengthen their response. \n\nOverall, while the candidate provides relevant experience, they could improve their answer by clearly articulating their interest in the specific position and demonstrating confidence in their decision to apply."

        "interviewer": "Thank you for sharing that information. It sounds like you have relevant experience with guest services and access management.

Can you give me an example of how you've handled a challenging communication situation with a visitor or staff member in your current position?",
        "candidate": " Sure, so there was a case of double booking where I was left to attend to the customer even though I did not book them and they were pretty angry when they got to their room and found someone else in their room and the best I could do was calm them down and explain to them that this was a fault of the system and not any particular individual and then I had to contact conference in charge of bookings to get them a separate room. Yes, so this is how I handled it.",

This demonstrates their ability to manage difficult interactions with customers, which is essential for the role at the University of Edinburgh.\n\n2. The candidate effectively explains the steps they took to calm the customer and clarify that the issue was a system fault rather than an individual error. This shows good communication skills and a focus on problem-solving.\n\n3. However, the response could be improved by including more detail about how they specifically calmed the customer down. For instance, mentioning any specific techniques or phrases they used could provide a clearer picture of their communication skills in action.\n\n4. The phrase \"the best I could do was calm them down\" may imply a limitation in their ability to resolve the situation. A more positive framing, such as emphasizing their proactive approach to finding a solution, would enhance the impression of their communication skills.\n\n5. The candidate could also mention any follow-up actions taken after resolving the immediate issue, which would demonstrate a commitment to customer satisfaction and continuous improvement.\n\nOverall, while the candidate's answer is relevant and demonstrates their experience, adding more detail about their communication techniques and framing their actions positively would strengthen their response."
