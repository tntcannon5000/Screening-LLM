        "candidate": " I'm sure. I currently work as a part-time receptionist at the University of Kent and I'm looking to transition into... I mean, I'm looking to move to Edinburgh and this would be a good fit for me since I already have the experience.",
        "feedback": "The accuracy of the answer provided is 80%.\n\n**Inaccuracies:**\n1. The candidate mentions they are currently working as a part-time receptionist at the University of Kent. While this indicates relevant experience, it does not directly address what specifically attracted them to the position at the University of Edinburgh. The answer could have included more details about their interest in the specific role or the university itself.\n2. The phrase \"I'm looking to transition into... I mean, I'm looking to move to Edinburgh\" suggests hesitation or uncertainty, which may not convey confidence in their decision to apply for the position.\n\n**Feedback:**\n- It would be beneficial for the candidate to elaborate on their motivations for applying to the University of Edinburgh specifically, such as the university's reputation, values, or the specific responsibilities of the role that appeal to them.\n- Confidence in their response could be improved by avoiding filler phrases and clearly stating their intentions and enthusiasm for the position."

        "interviewer": "That's great to hear about your current experience as a part-time receptionist. Could you tell me more about your specific duties in your current role and how they might relate to this position at the University of Edinburgh?",
        "candidate": " Um, sure. Currently I'm in charge of programming fobs to take guests, sorry, currently I'm in charge of programming fobs to allow guests to have access to specific rooms. I also have to connect guests with housekeeping if they have any problem or to attend any other problems they might have, such as shortage of bed sheets, fans, air trials, etc.",

        "feedback": "**Accuracy Percentage:** 75%\n\n**Inaccuracies:**\n1. The candidate mentions they are \"in charge of programming fobs to allow guests to have access to specific rooms.\" While this is relevant to the role of a receptionist, it does not fully encompass the range of duties typically expected in a receptionist position, such as greeting guests, answering calls, and managing reservations. The answer could have included more details about other responsibilities that align with the role at the University of Edinburgh.\n   \n2. The candidate states they \"connect guests with housekeeping if they have any problem.\" While this is a relevant task, it lacks specificity regarding how they handle guest inquiries or issues, which is a critical part of a receptionist's role. More detail on their communication skills or problem-solving abilities would strengthen the response.\n\n**Feedback:**\n- It would be beneficial for the candidate to elaborate on additional responsibilities they handle, such as managing guest check-ins and check-outs, answering phone calls, or providing information about hotel services. This would demonstrate a broader understanding of the receptionist role and how their experience aligns with the expectations at the University of Edinburgh.\n- Including examples of how they effectively communicate with guests or resolve issues would enhance their answer and showcase their customer service skills, which are essential for a receptionist position."

        "interviewer": "Thank you for sharing that information. It sounds like you have relevant experience with guest services and access management. For this role at the University of Edinburgh, strong communication skills are essential. Can you give me an example of how you've handled a challenging communication situation with a visitor or staff member in your current position?",
        "candidate": " Sure, so there was a case of double booking where I was left to attend to the customer even though I did not book them and they were pretty angry when they got to their room and found someone else in their room and the best I could do was calm them down and explain to them that this was a fault of the system and not any particular individual and then I had to contact conference in charge of bookings to get them a separate room. Yes, so this is how I handled it.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a mix of emotions dominated by calmness (0.44) and concentration (0.35), but also showed notable levels of tiredness (0.16), disappointment (0.14), and determination (0.12), suggesting a composed yet somewhat fatigued demeanor with an underlying sense of resolve despite some setbacks.",
        "feedback": "**Accuracy Percentage:** 70%\n\n**Inaccuracies:**\n1. The candidate describes a situation involving a double booking but does not provide a clear explanation of how they calmed the customer down or the specific communication techniques they used. This lack of detail makes it difficult to assess their communication skills effectively.\n   \n2. The candidate mentions that the issue was a fault of the system and not any particular individual, but they could have elaborated on how they took responsibility in the situation to reassure the guest. This would demonstrate accountability and empathy, which are important in guest services.\n\n3. The response lacks a structured approach to problem-solving. While the candidate mentions contacting the conference in charge of bookings, they do not detail how they ensured the guest felt valued and supported during the resolution process.\n\n**Feedback:**\n- It would be beneficial for the candidate to include specific examples of how they communicated with the upset customer, such as using calming language, actively listening to their concerns, or offering sincere apologies. This would showcase their strong communication skills.\n- The candidate should emphasize their role in resolving the issue and how they made the guest feel comfortable during the process. This could involve mentioning any follow-up actions they took to ensure the guest's satisfaction.\n- Providing a more structured narrative of the situation, including the steps taken to resolve the issue and the outcome, would enhance the clarity and effectiveness of their response."
