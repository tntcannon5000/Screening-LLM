        "interviewer": "Hello! Thank you for taking the time to speak with me today about the Part-Time Receptionist position at the University of Edinburgh. I'd like to ask you a few questions to learn more about your qualifications and interest in this role. Could you start by telling me what attracted you to this position?",
        "candidate": " I'm sure. I currently work as a part-time receptionist at the University of Kent and I'm looking to transition into... I mean, I'm looking to move to Edinburgh and this would be a good fit for me since I already have the experience.",
        "feedback": "The accuracy of the answer provided is 80%.\n\n**Inaccuracies:**\n1. The candidate mentions they are currently working as a part-time receptionist at the University of Kent. While this indicates relevant experience, it does not directly address what specifically attracted them to the position at the University of Edinburgh. The answer could have included more details about their interest in the specific role or the university itself.\n2. The phrase \"I'm looking to transition into... I mean, I'm looking to move to Edinburgh\" suggests hesitation or uncertainty, which may not convey confidence in their decision to apply for the position.\n\n**Feedback:**\n- It would be beneficial for the candidate to elaborate on their motivations for applying to the University of Edinburgh specifically, such as the university's reputation, values, or the specific responsibilities of the role that appeal to them.\n- Confidence in their response could be improved by avoiding filler phrases and clearly stating their intentions and enthusiasm for the position."

        "interviewer": "That's great to hear about your current experience as a part-time receptionist. Could you tell me more about your specific duties in your current role and how they might relate to this position at the University of Edinburgh?",
        "candidate": " Um, sure. Currently I'm in charge of programming fobs to take guests, sorry, currently I'm in charge of programming fobs to allow guests to have access to specific rooms. I also have to connect guests with housekeeping if they have any problem or to attend any other problems they might have, such as shortage of bed sheets, fans, air trials, etc.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a high level of interest (0.655) and enthusiasm (0.384), coupled with strong concentration (0.123) and determination (0.220), while maintaining a contemplative (0.414) and calm (0.108) demeanor, suggesting a thoughtful and engaged approach to the interview question without any significant negative emotions or toxic behaviors.",
        "feedback": "**Accuracy Percentage:** 75%\n\n**Inaccuracies:**\n1. The candidate mentions they are \"in charge of programming fobs to allow guests to have access to specific rooms.\" While this is relevant to a receptionist's duties, it does not fully encompass the range of responsibilities typically associated with a receptionist role, such as greeting guests, answering calls, and managing reservations. The answer could have included more details about other tasks they perform that are directly related to the receptionist position.\n   \n2. The candidate states they \"connect guests with housekeeping if they have any problem.\" This is somewhat vague and could be elaborated upon. It would be beneficial to specify how they facilitate communication between guests and housekeeping, as this is a key aspect of a receptionist's role.\n\n3. The mention of \"attending to any other problems they might have, such as shortage of bed sheets, fans, air trials, etc.\" is not clearly articulated. The term \"air trials\" seems out of place and may be a transcription error. It would be more effective to list common issues they handle in a clearer manner.\n\n**Feedback:**\n- The candidate should aim to provide a more comprehensive overview of their duties as a receptionist, including tasks such as greeting guests, managing reservations, and handling inquiries. This would better demonstrate their suitability for the position at the University of Edinburgh.\n- Clarifying the process of connecting guests with housekeeping and providing specific examples of common issues they resolve would strengthen their response.\n- The candidate should ensure that all terms used are relevant and accurately reflect their responsibilities to avoid confusion."

        "interviewer": "Thank you for sharing that information. It sounds like you have relevant experience with guest services and access management. For this role at the University of Edinburgh, strong communication skills are essential. Can you give me an example of how you've handled a challenging communication situation with a visitor or staff member in your current position?",
        "candidate": " Sure, so there was a case of double booking where I was left to attend to the customer even though I did not book them and they were pretty angry when they got to their room and found someone else in their room and the best I could do was calm them down and explain to them that this was a fault of the system and not any particular individual and then I had to contact conference in charge of bookings to get them a separate room. Yes, so this is how I handled it.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a mix of emotions dominated by calmness (0.44) and concentration (0.35), but also showed notable levels of tiredness (0.16), disappointment (0.14), and determination (0.12), suggesting they were composed yet potentially fatigued or slightly discouraged during this part of the interview, while still maintaining focus and resolve.",
        "feedback": "**Accuracy Percentage:** 70%\n\n**Inaccuracies:**\n1. The candidate describes a situation involving a double booking but does not provide a clear resolution process. While they mention contacting the conference in charge of bookings, they could have elaborated on the steps taken to ensure the guest was accommodated appropriately, such as offering a room of equal or better standard, which is a best practice in handling double bookings.\n   \n2. The candidate states, \"the best I could do was calm them down,\" which may imply a lack of proactive problem-solving. It would be more effective to highlight specific actions taken to resolve the issue beyond just calming the guest, such as offering alternatives or ensuring they were satisfied with the resolution.\n\n3. The explanation of the situation lacks detail about the communication strategies used to de-escalate the situation. For example, mentioning specific phrases or techniques used to reassure the guest would strengthen the response and demonstrate effective communication skills.\n\n**Feedback:**\n- The candidate should aim to provide a more comprehensive overview of the resolution process for the double booking, including specific actions taken to accommodate the guest and ensure their satisfaction.\n- Highlighting effective communication techniques used during the interaction would demonstrate their strong communication skills, which are essential for the role at the University of Edinburgh.\n- Providing a clearer narrative of the situation, including the emotions of the guest and how they were addressed, would enhance the overall response and showcase the candidate's ability to handle challenging communication situations effectively."
