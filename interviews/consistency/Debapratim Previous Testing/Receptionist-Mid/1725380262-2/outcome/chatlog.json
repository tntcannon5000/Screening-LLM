I'd like to ask you a few questions to learn more about your qualifications and interest in this role. Could you start by telling me what attracted you to this position?",
        "candidate": " I'm sure. I currently work as a part-time receptionist at the University of Kent and I'm looking to transition into... I mean, I'm looking to move to Edinburgh and this would be a good fit for me since I already have the experience.",
        "feedback": "The accuracy of the answer provided is 75%.\n\n**Inaccuracies:**\n1. The candidate mentions they are currently working as a part-time receptionist at the University of Kent. While this indicates relevant experience, it does not directly address what specifically attracted them to the position at the University of Edinburgh. The answer could have included more details about their interest in the specific role or the university itself.\n2. The phrase \"I'm looking to transition into... I mean, I'm looking to move to Edinburgh\" suggests hesitation or uncertainty, which may not convey confidence in their decision to apply for the position.\n\n**Feedback:**\n- It would be beneficial for the candidate to elaborate on their motivations for applying to the University of Edinburgh specifically, such as the university's reputation, values, or the specific responsibilities of the role that appeal to them.\n- Confidence in expressing their intentions can enhance the impression they leave during the interview. Encouraging them to practice their responses could help mitigate any hesitations in their speech."

        "interviewer": "That's great to hear about your current experience as a part-time receptionist. Could you tell me more about your specific duties in your current role and how they might relate to this position at the University of Edinburgh?",
        "candidate": " Um, sure. Currently I'm in charge of programming fobs to take guests, sorry, currently I'm in charge of programming fobs to allow guests to have access to specific rooms. I also have to connect guests with housekeeping if they have any problem or to attend any other problems they might have, such as shortage of bed sheets, fans, air trials, etc.",

        "feedback": "**Accuracy Percentage:** 80%\n\n**Inaccuracies:**\n1. The candidate mentions they are \"in charge of programming fobs to allow guests to have access to specific rooms.\" While this is relevant to the duties of a receptionist, it could be more clearly connected to the responsibilities expected at the University of Edinburgh. The answer could benefit from explicitly stating how this experience translates to the new role.\n2. The candidate states they \"connect guests with housekeeping if they have any problem,\" which is a relevant duty. However, they could enhance their response by mentioning how this experience demonstrates their ability to handle guest inquiries and maintain communication between departments, which is crucial in a university setting.\n\n**Feedback:**\n- It would be beneficial for the candidate to elaborate on how their current responsibilities directly relate to the specific duties of the receptionist position at the University of Edinburgh.

        "interviewer": "Thank you for sharing that information. It sounds like you have relevant experience with guest services and access management. For this role at the University of Edinburgh, strong communication skills are essential. Can you give me an example of how you've handled a challenging communication situation with a visitor or staff member in your current position?",
        "candidate": " Sure, so there was a case of double booking where I was left to attend to the customer even though I did not book them and they were pretty angry when they got to their room and found someone else in their room and the best I could do was calm them down and explain to them that this was a fault of the system and not any particular individual and then I had to contact conference in charge of bookings to get them a separate room. Yes, so this is how I handled it.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a notable level of calmness (0.438) and concentration (0.347), but also displayed signs of tiredness (0.161), disappointment (0.135), and annoyance (0.289), suggesting a composed yet somewhat frustrated demeanor during this part of the interview.",
        "feedback": "**Accuracy Percentage:** 70%\n\n**Inaccuracies:**\n1. The candidate describes a situation involving a double booking but does not clearly articulate the steps they took to resolve the issue beyond calming the customer. While they mention contacting the conference in charge of bookings, they could have elaborated on how they communicated with the guest throughout the process, which is crucial in a guest services role.\n2. The candidate states, \"the best I could do was calm them down,\" which may imply a lack of confidence in their ability to handle the situation effectively. This phrasing could be perceived as minimizing their role in resolving the issue, rather than showcasing their proactive approach to customer service.\n\n**Feedback:**\n- It would be beneficial for the candidate to provide more detail on how they maintained communication with the guest during the resolution process. For example, they could mention if they provided updates or reassured the guest while waiting for a new room to be arranged.\n- Encouraging the candidate to frame their response in a way that highlights their problem-solving skills and ability to manage difficult situations could enhance their answer. Instead of saying \"the best I could do,\" they might express it as \"I took the initiative to calm the guest and ensure they were informed throughout the resolution process.\" This would convey a more confident and proactive approach to customer service."
