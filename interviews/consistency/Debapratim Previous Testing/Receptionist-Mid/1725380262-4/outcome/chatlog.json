        "feedback": "The accuracy of the answer provided is 75%.\n\n**Inaccuracies:**\n1. The candidate mentions they are currently working as a part-time receptionist at the University of Kent. While this indicates relevant experience, it does not directly address what specifically attracted them to the position at the University of Edinburgh. The answer could have included more details about their interest in the specific role or the university itself.\n2. The phrase \"I'm looking to transition into... I mean, I'm looking to move to Edinburgh\" suggests uncertainty or hesitation, which may not convey confidence in their decision to apply for the position.\n\n**Feedback:**\n- It would be beneficial for the candidate to elaborate on their motivations for applying to the University of Edinburgh specifically, such as the university's reputation, values, or the specific responsibilities of the role that appeal to them.\n- Confidence in expressing their intentions can enhance their response. Instead of hesitating, they could clearly state their desire to move to Edinburgh and how this position aligns with their career goals."

        "candidate": " Um, sure. Currently I'm in charge of programming fobs to take guests, sorry, currently I'm in charge of programming fobs to allow guests to have access to specific rooms.

        "feedback": "**Accuracy Percentage:** 80%\n\n**Inaccuracies:**\n1. The candidate mentions they are \"in charge of programming fobs to allow guests to have access to specific rooms.\" While this is relevant to the role of a receptionist, it could be more clearly connected to the responsibilities expected at the University of Edinburgh. The answer could benefit from explicitly stating how this experience translates to the specific duties of the receptionist position at the university.\n2. The candidate states they \"connect guests with housekeeping if they have any problem.\" While this is a relevant duty, it could be enhanced by providing more detail about how they handle guest inquiries or issues, which would demonstrate their problem-solving skills and customer service abilities.\n\n**Feedback:**\n- It would be beneficial for the candidate to elaborate on how their current responsibilities directly relate to the specific tasks they would be performing at the University of Edinburgh.

        "interviewer": "Thank you for sharing that information. It sounds like you have relevant experience with guest services and access management. For this role at the University of Edinburgh, strong communication skills are essential. Can you give me an example of how you've handled a challenging communication situation with a visitor or staff member in your current position?",
        "candidate": " Sure, so there was a case of double booking where I was left to attend to the customer even though I did not book them and they were pretty angry when they got to their room and found someone else in their room and the best I could do was calm them down and explain to them that this was a fault of the system and not any particular individual and then I had to contact conference in charge of bookings to get them a separate room. Yes, so this is how I handled it.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a mix of emotions dominated by calmness (0.44) and concentration (0.35), but also showed notable levels of tiredness (0.16), disappointment (0.14), and determination (0.12), suggesting they were composed yet potentially struggling with some aspects of the interview while maintaining focus and effort.",
        "feedback": "**Accuracy Percentage:** 70%\n\n**Inaccuracies:**\n1. The candidate describes a situation involving a double booking but does not provide a clear resolution process that aligns with best practices for handling such situations. While they mention contacting the conference in charge of bookings, they do not detail how they ensured the guest was accommodated in a room of the same or better standard, which is a critical aspect of resolving double bookings effectively.\n2. The candidate states, \"the best I could do was calm them down,\" which may imply a lack of proactive problem-solving. It would be more effective to emphasize how they took initiative to resolve the issue rather than just calming the guest.\n\n**Feedback:**\n- The candidate should elaborate on the steps they took to resolve the double booking beyond calming the guest. For example, they could mention how they ensured the guest received a suitable alternative room and any additional measures they took to enhance the guest's experience during the situation.\n- Highlighting specific communication techniques used to de-escalate the situation and reassure the guest would strengthen their response. This could include phrases they used or how they maintained a positive demeanor despite the challenging circumstances."
