        "feedback": "The accuracy of the answer provided is 80%.\n\n**Inaccuracies:**\n1. The candidate mentions they are currently working as a part-time receptionist at the University of Kent.

        "interviewer": "That's great to hear about your current experience as a part-time receptionist. Could you tell me more about your specific duties in your current role and how they might relate to this position at the University of Edinburgh?",
        "candidate": " Um, sure. Currently I'm in charge of programming fobs to take guests, sorry, currently I'm in charge of programming fobs to allow guests to have access to specific rooms.

        "feedback": "**Accuracy Score:** 75%\n\n**Inaccuracies:**\n1. The candidate mentions they are \"in charge of programming fobs to allow guests to have access to specific rooms.\" While this is relevant to the duties of a receptionist, it does not fully connect to the broader responsibilities typically expected in a receptionist role, such as greeting guests, answering inquiries, or managing reservations. The answer could have included more about these aspects to better relate to the position at the University of Edinburgh.\n   \n2. The candidate states they \"connect guests with housekeeping if they have any problem.\" While this is a relevant duty, it lacks detail on how they handle guest inquiries or issues, which is a critical part of a receptionist's role. Providing examples of how they manage guest requests or complaints would strengthen the response.\n\n**Feedback:**\n- It would be beneficial for the candidate to elaborate on their experience with guest interactions, such as greeting guests, answering questions, or managing reservations, as these are key responsibilities for a receptionist.\n- Including specific examples of how they have successfully resolved guest issues or improved guest experiences would demonstrate their capability and suitability for the role at the University of Edinburgh.\n- Encouraging the candidate to practice articulating their experiences in a way that highlights their customer service skills and ability to handle various situations could enhance their response."

        "interviewer": "Thank you for sharing that information. It sounds like you have relevant experience with guest services and access management. For this role at the University of Edinburgh, strong communication skills are essential. Can you give me an example of how you've handled a challenging communication situation with a visitor or staff member in your current position?",
        "candidate": " Sure, so there was a case of double booking where I was left to attend to the customer even though I did not book them and they were pretty angry when they got to their room and found someone else in their room and the best I could do was calm them down and explain to them that this was a fault of the system and not any particular individual and then I had to contact conference in charge of bookings to get them a separate room. Yes, so this is how I handled it.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a mix of emotions dominated by calmness (0.44) and concentration (0.35), but also showed notable levels of tiredness (0.16), disappointment (0.14), and determination (0.12), suggesting they were composed yet somewhat fatigued and potentially dissatisfied while focusing on the interview question.",
        "feedback": "**Accuracy Score:** 70%\n\n**Inaccuracies:**\n1. The candidate describes a situation involving a double booking but does not provide a clear resolution process that aligns with best practices for handling such situations. While they mention contacting the conference in charge of bookings, they do not detail how they ensured the guest was accommodated in a room of the same or better standard, which is a critical aspect of resolving double bookings effectively.\n   \n2. The candidate states, \"the best I could do was calm them down,\" which may imply a lack of proactive problem-solving. It would be more effective to highlight specific actions taken to resolve the issue beyond just calming the guest, such as offering alternatives or ensuring their needs were met promptly.\n\n**Feedback:**\n- It would be beneficial for the candidate to elaborate on the steps they took to resolve the double booking, such as finding an alternative room or ensuring the guest received the same amenities they were promised. This would demonstrate their ability to handle challenging situations effectively.\n- Including specific details about how they communicated with the guest during the resolution process could enhance their response. For example, mentioning how they reassured the guest or provided updates while resolving the issue would showcase their strong communication skills.\n- Encouraging the candidate to practice articulating their problem-solving process in challenging situations can help them present a more comprehensive and confident response in future interviews."
