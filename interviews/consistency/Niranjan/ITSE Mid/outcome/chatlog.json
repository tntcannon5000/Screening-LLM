        "interviewer": "Hello! It's nice to meet you too. Thank you for taking the time to speak with me today about the Entry-Level IT Support Engineer role. To start off, could you tell me about your experience with Microsoft Windows, particularly in troubleshooting and resolving issues?",
        "candidate": " Sure, I'd be happy to. Over the last 10 years, I have experienced using Windows throughout these 10 years, maybe having used Windows 7 and then 10. And throughout that time, I've encountered a large amount of issues which I've had to solve. These have ranged from programs crashing, blue screens of death, system freezes, network issues, etc. And this extends into my work experience at G-Research as a technical support engineer, where my role was to deal with our corporate users, again, system crashes and system freezes and any level of technical issue across the entire corporate infrastructure that was related to a technical issue.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a high level of interest (0.465) and calmness (0.316), along with notable levels of satisfaction (0.207), admiration (0.210), and contentment (0.168), suggesting a positive and engaged demeanor during the interview, with sentiment scores leaning towards the more positive end of the scale (6-7 range), indicating an overall favorable impression without any significant signs of toxicity or negative emotions.",
        "feedback": "The accuracy of the answer provided is 85%.\n\nFeedback:\n1. The candidate mentions having \"experienced using Windows throughout these 10 years,\" which could be more clearly stated as having \"10 years of experience using Windows.\" This would enhance clarity and professionalism in the response.\n2. The candidate lists various issues encountered, such as \"programs crashing, blue screens of death, system freezes, network issues, etc.\" While this is relevant, it would be beneficial to provide specific examples of how they resolved these issues, as this would demonstrate their troubleshooting skills more effectively.\n3. The mention of their role at G-Research is relevant, but the answer could be improved by detailing specific troubleshooting steps or methods they employed to resolve the issues faced by corporate users. This would provide a clearer picture of their hands-on experience and problem-solving abilities. \n\nOverall, the candidate's experience is relevant, but providing more specific examples and clarifying their statements would strengthen their response."

        "interviewer": "Thank you for sharing that. Could you elaborate on your experience with Active Directory, particularly in areas like security groups, administration, or deployment?",
        "candidate": " Sure. I do have a bit of experience with Active Directory from G-Research where I had to assign and remove certain security groups which gave access to particular features. I've never deployed Active Directory before because that was handled by the corporate infrastructure team that I did work closely with. And general Active Directory administration would be based on what tickets we receive at any point in time via our ticket management system Jiro.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a high level of interest (0.334) and concentration (0.246), balanced with moderate levels of annoyance (0.227) and determination (0.123), suggesting they were engaged but potentially challenged or frustrated by the question, while maintaining a relatively neutral emotional stance as indicated by the mid-range sentiment scores.",
        "feedback": "The accuracy of the answer provided is 75%.\n\nFeedback:\n1. The candidate mentions assigning and removing security groups, which is relevant to Active Directory administration. However, they do not provide specific examples of the types of security groups they worked with or the permissions associated with those groups. Including this information would demonstrate a deeper understanding of Active Directory security groups and their functions.\n\n2. The candidate states that they have never deployed Active Directory and that this was handled by the corporate infrastructure team. While this is acceptable, it would be beneficial to mention any involvement they had in the deployment process, such as assisting with planning or configuration, to show a more comprehensive understanding of the deployment aspect.\n\n3. The mention of using a ticket management system (Jira) for general Active Directory administration is relevant, but the candidate does not elaborate on the types of tickets they handled or the specific issues they resolved. Providing examples of common issues or tasks they managed would enhance their response and showcase their practical experience.\n\nOverall, while the candidate's experience with security groups and administration is relevant, providing more specific examples and elaborating on their involvement in the deployment process would strengthen their answer."

        "interviewer": "I see. Can you tell me about your experience with Windows Server environments, particularly versions 2012 or 2016? Have you been involved in design, deployment, maintenance, or support of these systems?",
        "candidate": " Sure, I've been primarily involved in the support and maintenance of these systems where throughout UMG research we have approximately 200 Windows servers. Most of these are virtual machine servers which are ran on our VMware infrastructure but some of them were physical and if we ever received any issues relating any of these servers it was my role to fix these issues. These ranged from servers being down to not building up to needing to update packages for software that is used to run the services on the servers and more.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a predominantly calm and contemplative demeanor, with notable levels of concentration and contentment, while also displaying moderate interest and satisfaction, suggesting a composed and thoughtful approach to the interview question without any significant negative emotions or toxic behaviors.",
        "feedback": "**Accuracy Score:** 80%\n\n**Feedback:**\n\n1. The candidate mentions being \"primarily involved in the support and maintenance\" of approximately 200 Windows servers, which is relevant. However, they do not specify the types of services these servers were running or the specific roles they played in the maintenance process. Providing examples of the types of issues encountered or specific maintenance tasks performed would enhance their response.\n\n2. The candidate states that most of the servers are virtual machines running on VMware infrastructure, which is a good detail. However, they could improve their answer by briefly explaining their experience with VMware, such as any specific tasks they performed related to virtualization or how they managed the virtual environment.\n\n3. The candidate mentions fixing issues ranging from servers being down to needing to update packages. While this is relevant, they could strengthen their answer by providing specific examples of how they diagnosed and resolved these issues. For instance, mentioning any tools or methodologies used in troubleshooting would demonstrate their technical skills more effectively.\n\n4. The phrase \"if we ever received any issues relating any of these servers it was my role to fix these issues\" could be rephrased for clarity. A more direct statement about their responsibilities would enhance professionalism in the response.\n\nOverall, while the candidate's experience with Windows Server environments is relevant, providing more specific examples and elaborating on their technical skills would strengthen their answer."

        "interviewer": "Thank you for that information. Lastly, could you describe your experience with networking, particularly in areas like VLAN configuration, routing, switching, or troubleshooting TCP/IP issues?",
        "candidate": " Sure, I have some experience troubleshooting these. Our infrastructure was based on Cisco architecture, so we made use of Cisco Tracer to try to solve any issues that we were provided with.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a high level of annoyance (0.557) and determination (0.211), coupled with moderate levels of concentration (0.184) and disapproval (0.122), suggesting they were focused but noticeably irritated during their answer, potentially indicating frustration with the question or topic being discussed.",
        "feedback": "**Accuracy Score:** 70%\n\n**Feedback:**\n\n1. The candidate mentions using \"Cisco Tracer\" for troubleshooting, which may be a transcription error. The correct term is likely \"Cisco Packet Tracer\" or \"Cisco Tracer commands.\" This could lead to confusion about the specific tools they used for troubleshooting.\n\n2. The answer lacks detail regarding specific experiences with VLAN configuration, routing, switching, or TCP/IP troubleshooting. While the candidate mentions troubleshooting, they do not provide examples of the types of issues they encountered or how they resolved them.

The candidate does not mention any specific tools or commands used in their troubleshooting process, such as \"ping,\" \"tracert,\" or \"show commands,\" which are commonly employed in network troubleshooting. Providing this information would demonstrate a deeper understanding of the troubleshooting process.\n\n4. The response could benefit from a more structured approach, detailing the steps taken during troubleshooting or specific outcomes achieved. This would provide a clearer picture of their hands-on experience and problem-solving abilities in networking contexts."
