        "interviewer": "Hello! It's nice to meet you too. Thank you for taking the time to speak with me today about the Entry-Level IT Support Engineer role. To start off, could you tell me about your experience with Microsoft Windows, particularly in troubleshooting and resolving issues?",
        "candidate": " Sure, I'd be happy to. Over the last 10 years, I have experienced using Windows throughout these 10 years, maybe having used Windows 7 and then 10. And throughout that time, I've encountered a large amount of issues which I've had to solve. These have ranged from programs crashing, blue screens of death, system freezes, network issues, etc. And this extends into my work experience at G-Research as a technical support engineer, where my role was to deal with our corporate users, again, system crashes and system freezes and any level of technical issue across the entire corporate infrastructure that was related to a technical issue.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a high level of interest (0.465) and calmness (0.316), along with notable levels of satisfaction (0.207) and admiration (0.210), suggesting they were engaged and composed during the interview, while also displaying a positive and respectful attitude towards the topic or interviewer.",
        "feedback": "The accuracy of the answer provided is 85%.\n\nFeedback on inaccuracies:\n\n1. **Experience Duration**: The candidate states they have \"over the last 10 years\" of experience with Windows. However, they mention using Windows 7 and 10, which suggests they may not have been using Windows for the entire 10 years, as Windows 7 was released in 2009 and Windows 10 in 2015. This could lead to confusion about the actual duration of their experience with each version.\n\n2. **Specificity of Issues**: While the candidate lists various issues they have encountered (program crashes, blue screens of death, system freezes, network issues), they could have provided more specific examples or methods they used to troubleshoot these issues. This would enhance the credibility of their experience and demonstrate their problem-solving skills more effectively.\n\n3. **Role Description**: The candidate mentions their role at G-Research as a technical support engineer but does not elaborate on specific tools or techniques they used to resolve issues. Including this information would provide a clearer picture of their hands-on experience and technical proficiency.\n\nOverall, the candidate demonstrates a solid understanding of common Windows issues and their experience in a technical support role, but could improve by providing more detailed examples and clarifying the duration of their experience with different Windows versions."

        "interviewer": "Thank you for sharing that. Could you elaborate on your experience with Active Directory, particularly in areas like security groups, administration, or deployment?",
        "candidate": " Sure. I do have a bit of experience with Active Directory from G-Research where I had to assign and remove certain security groups which gave access to particular features. I've never deployed Active Directory before because that was handled by the corporate infrastructure team that I did work closely with. And general Active Directory administration would be based on what tickets we receive at any point in time via our ticket management system Jiro.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a high level of interest (0.338) and concentration (0.299), coupled with moderate determination (0.193) and calmness (0.136), suggesting they were engaged and focused during the interview, while also displaying some annoyance (0.160) and contemplation (0.113), which could indicate they were carefully considering their responses or potentially struggling with certain aspects of the question.",
        "feedback": "The accuracy of the answer provided is 75%.\n\nFeedback on inaccuracies:\n\n1. **Experience with Security Groups**: The candidate mentions assigning and removing security groups but does not elaborate on the specific types of security groups they worked with or the processes involved. Providing more detail about the types of security groups (e.g., distribution vs. security groups) and the implications of these actions would enhance the answer.\n\n2. **Collaboration with Infrastructure Team**: While the candidate states they worked closely with the corporate infrastructure team for deployment, they do not specify what aspects of Active Directory deployment they were involved in or how their collaboration contributed to the deployment process. More detail on their role in this collaboration would clarify their experience.\n\n3. **Active Directory Administration**: The candidate mentions that general administration is based on tickets received via a ticket management system (Jira). However, they do not provide examples of the types of tickets they handled or the specific administrative tasks they performed. Including examples of common issues or tasks would strengthen their response and demonstrate their hands-on experience.\n\nOverall, while the candidate demonstrates some familiarity with Active Directory and its security groups, they could improve their answer by providing more specific examples and details about their experiences and responsibilities."

        "interviewer": "I see. Can you tell me about your experience with Windows Server environments, particularly versions 2012 or 2016? Have you been involved in design, deployment, maintenance, or support of these systems?",
        "candidate": " Sure, I've been primarily involved in the support and maintenance of these systems where throughout UMG research we have approximately 200 Windows servers. Most of these are virtual machine servers which are ran on our VMware infrastructure but some of them were physical and if we ever received any issues relating any of these servers it was my role to fix these issues. These ranged from servers being down to not building up to needing to update packages for software that is used to run the services on the servers and more.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a high level of calmness (0.53) and concentration (0.22), along with notable contentment (0.22) and satisfaction (0.20), suggesting a composed and focused demeanor during the interview, while also displaying a moderate level of interest (0.14) and contemplation (0.15), which are positive traits for an interviewee.",
        "feedback": "**Accuracy Score: 80%**\n\n**Feedback on inaccuracies:**\n\n1. **Experience with Windows Server Versions**: The candidate mentions primarily supporting and maintaining Windows servers but does not specify their experience with Windows Server 2012 or 2016 in particular. Providing details about specific tasks or challenges faced with these versions would enhance the answer.\n\n2. **Virtualization Details**: While the candidate states that most of the servers are virtual machines running on VMware infrastructure, they do not elaborate on their experience with VMware itself or any specific tasks related to virtualization management. Including examples of how they managed or troubleshot virtual machines would strengthen their response.\n\n3. **Types of Issues Resolved**: The candidate lists various issues they resolved but could provide more specific examples of the types of problems encountered with Windows Server environments. This would demonstrate a deeper understanding of the systems and their complexities.\n\n4. **Role in Maintenance**: The candidate mentions their role in fixing issues but does not detail any proactive maintenance tasks they performed, such as monitoring server performance, applying updates, or managing backups. Including this information would provide a more comprehensive view of their responsibilities.\n\nOverall, while the candidate demonstrates relevant experience in supporting Windows servers, they could improve their answer by providing more specific examples and details about their experiences with the particular versions mentioned in the question."
