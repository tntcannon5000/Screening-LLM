        "interviewer": "Hello! It's nice to meet you too. Thank you for taking the time to speak with me today about the Entry-Level IT Support Engineer role. To start off, could you tell me about your experience with Microsoft Windows, particularly in troubleshooting and resolving issues?",
        "candidate": " Sure, I'd be happy to. Over the last 10 years, I have experienced using Windows throughout these 10 years, maybe having used Windows 7 and then 10. And throughout that time, I've encountered a large amount of issues which I've had to solve. These have ranged from programs crashing, blue screens of death, system freezes, network issues, etc. And this extends into my work experience at G-Research as a technical support engineer, where my role was to deal with our corporate users, again, system crashes and system freezes and any level of technical issue across the entire corporate infrastructure that was related to a technical issue.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a high level of interest (0.465) and calmness (0.316), coupled with moderate levels of satisfaction (0.207), admiration (0.210), and contentment (0.168), suggesting they were engaged, composed, and positively disposed during this part of the interview, which are generally favorable traits for a successful interview performance.",
        "feedback": "The accuracy of the answer provided is 85%.\n\nFeedback on inaccuracies:\n\n1. **Experience Duration**: The candidate mentioned having \"10 years\" of experience with Windows, but it would be more accurate to specify the exact years of experience with each version (Windows 7 and 10) rather than a general statement. This could lead to confusion about the depth of experience with each version.\n\n2. **Specificity of Issues**: While the candidate listed various issues (program crashes, blue screens of death, system freezes, network issues), it would strengthen the answer to provide specific examples or methods used to troubleshoot these issues. This would demonstrate a deeper understanding of the troubleshooting process.\n\n3. **Role Description**: The candidate mentioned their role at G-Research but could enhance the answer by detailing specific tools or techniques they used to resolve issues. This would provide a clearer picture of their hands-on experience and problem-solving skills.\n\nOverall, the candidate's response is solid but could benefit from more specificity and detail regarding their troubleshooting methods and experiences."

        "interviewer": "Thank you for sharing that. Could you elaborate on your experience with Active Directory, particularly in areas like security groups, administration, or deployment?",
        "candidate": " Sure. I do have a bit of experience with Active Directory from G-Research where I had to assign and remove certain security groups which gave access to particular features. I've never deployed Active Directory before because that was handled by the corporate infrastructure team that I did work closely with. And general Active Directory administration would be based on what tickets we receive at any point in time via our ticket management system Jiro.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited strong feelings of annoyance (0.49) and disappointment (0.20), coupled with noticeable disapproval (0.21), suggesting a negative emotional state that could be concerning in an interview setting, especially given the low positive sentiment scores and relatively high negative sentiment scores (0.34 for sentiment level 2).",
        "feedback": "The accuracy of the answer provided is 75%.\n\nFeedback on inaccuracies:\n\n1. **Experience with Security Groups**: The candidate mentioned assigning and removing security groups but did not elaborate on the specific types of security groups they worked with or the permissions associated with them. Providing details about the types of security groups (e.g., Domain Admins, Domain Users) and the context in which they were used would enhance the answer.\n\n2. **Collaboration with Infrastructure Team**: While the candidate stated they worked closely with the corporate infrastructure team for deployment, they did not mention any specific interactions or contributions they made during that process. Including examples of how they collaborated or any insights gained from that experience would strengthen their response.\n\n3. **Active Directory Administration**: The candidate mentioned handling tickets via a ticket management system (Jira), but they did not provide specific examples of the types of issues they addressed or how they resolved them. Including specific scenarios or challenges faced in Active Directory administration would demonstrate a deeper understanding of the role.\n\nOverall, while the candidate provided a general overview of their experience with Active Directory, more specific details and examples would improve the clarity and depth of their response."

        "interviewer": "I see. Can you tell me about your experience with Windows Server environments, particularly versions 2012 or 2016? Have you been involved in design, deployment, maintenance, or support of these systems?",
        "candidate": " Sure, I've been primarily involved in the support and maintenance of these systems where throughout UMG research we have approximately 200 Windows servers. Most of these are virtual machine servers which are ran on our VMware infrastructure but some of them were physical and if we ever received any issues relating any of these servers it was my role to fix these issues. These ranged from servers being down to not building up to needing to update packages for software that is used to run the services on the servers and more.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a high level of calmness (0.45) and concentration (0.24), coupled with a notable degree of contemplation (0.25) and interest (0.14), suggesting a composed and engaged demeanor during the interview, while also displaying some contentment (0.11) and satisfaction (0.09), which are generally positive traits in an interview setting.",
        "feedback": "**Accuracy Score: 80%**\n\n**Feedback on Inaccuracies:**\n\n1. **Experience with Windows Server Versions**: The candidate did not specify their experience with Windows Server versions 2012 or 2016, which was a key part of the question. While they mentioned working with approximately 200 Windows servers, it would be beneficial to clarify if any of these were specifically Windows Server 2012 or 2016.\n\n2. **Role in Design and Deployment**: The candidate focused primarily on support and maintenance but did not mention any involvement in the design or deployment of Windows Server environments. Including any experience in these areas, even if limited, would provide a more comprehensive view of their capabilities.\n\n3. **Specific Issues Resolved**: While the candidate mentioned various issues they resolved, they could enhance their answer by providing specific examples of the types of problems encountered and the solutions implemented. This would demonstrate a deeper understanding of the challenges faced in a Windows Server environment.\n\n4. **Virtualization Context**: The candidate mentioned that most of the servers were virtual machines running on VMware infrastructure. However, they did not elaborate on any specific challenges or experiences related to virtualization, such as VM sprawl or resource allocation issues, which are common in such environments. Including this information would strengthen their response.\n\nOverall, while the candidate provided a solid overview of their experience with Windows servers, more detail regarding specific versions, roles in design and deployment, and examples of issues resolved would improve the clarity and depth of their response."
