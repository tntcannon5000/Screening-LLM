        "interviewer": "Hello! It's nice to meet you too. Thank you for taking the time to speak with me today about the Entry-Level IT Support Engineer role. To start off, could you tell me about your experience with Microsoft Windows, particularly in troubleshooting and resolving issues?",
        "candidate": " Sure, I'd be happy to. Over the last 10 years, I have experienced using Windows throughout these 10 years, maybe having used Windows 7 and then 10. And throughout that time, I've encountered a large amount of issues which I've had to solve. These have ranged from programs crashing, blue screens of death, system freezes, network issues, etc. And this extends into my work experience at G-Research as a technical support engineer, where my role was to deal with our corporate users, again, system crashes and system freezes and any level of technical issue across the entire corporate infrastructure that was related to a technical issue.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a high level of interest (0.465) and calmness (0.316), along with notable levels of satisfaction (0.207), admiration (0.210), and contentment (0.168), suggesting they were engaged, composed, and positive during this part of the interview, which are generally desirable traits in a professional setting.",
        "feedback": "The accuracy of the answer provided is 85%.\n\nFeedback on inaccuracies:\n\n1. **Experience Duration**: The candidate states they have \"over the last 10 years\" of experience using Windows. However, they mention using Windows 7 and 10, which were released in 2009 and 2015, respectively. This suggests that their experience with Windows may not span a full 10 years, as Windows 7 would not have been used for the entire duration mentioned.\n\n2. **Specificity of Issues**: While the candidate lists various issues they have encountered (program crashes, blue screens of death, system freezes, network issues), they could have provided more specific examples or methods they used to troubleshoot these issues. This would demonstrate a deeper understanding of the troubleshooting process.\n\n3. **Role at G-Research**: The candidate mentions their role at G-Research but does not specify any particular tools or techniques they used to resolve issues. Including this information would strengthen their response and provide a clearer picture of their hands-on experience.\n\nOverall, the candidate demonstrates relevant experience but could enhance their answer by providing more specific details and clarifications regarding their experience duration and troubleshooting methods."

        "interviewer": "Thank you for sharing that. Could you elaborate on your experience with Active Directory, particularly in areas like security groups, administration, or deployment?",
        "candidate": " Sure. I do have a bit of experience with Active Directory from G-Research where I had to assign and remove certain security groups which gave access to particular features. I've never deployed Active Directory before because that was handled by the corporate infrastructure team that I did work closely with. And general Active Directory administration would be based on what tickets we receive at any point in time via our ticket management system Jiro.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a high level of interest (0.338) and concentration (0.299), coupled with moderate determination (0.193) and calmness (0.136), suggesting they were engaged and focused during the interview, while also displaying some annoyance (0.160) and contemplation (0.113), which could indicate they were carefully considering their responses or potentially struggling with certain aspects of the question.",
        "feedback": "The accuracy of the answer provided is 75%.\n\nFeedback on inaccuracies:\n\n1. **Experience with Security Groups**: The candidate mentions assigning and removing security groups but does not elaborate on the specific types of security groups they worked with or the processes involved. Providing more detail about the types of security groups (e.g., distribution vs. security groups) and the implications of these actions would demonstrate a deeper understanding of Active Directory.\n\n2. **Collaboration with Infrastructure Team**: While the candidate states they worked closely with the corporate infrastructure team for deployment, they do not mention any specific interactions or contributions they made during this process. Including examples of how they collaborated or any insights gained from this experience would enhance their response.\n\n3. **Active Directory Administration**: The candidate mentions handling tickets via a ticket management system (Jira), but they do not provide specific examples of the types of issues they resolved or the administrative tasks they performed. More concrete examples of their responsibilities or challenges faced would strengthen their answer.\n\n4. **General Knowledge of Active Directory**: The answer lacks a broader understanding of Active Directory's role in security and access management. Including information about best practices for managing security groups or the importance of limiting access to privileged groups would show a more comprehensive grasp of Active Directory's significance in an organization.\n\nOverall, while the candidate demonstrates some relevant experience with Active Directory, they could improve their answer by providing more specific details and examples related to security groups, collaboration, and administration tasks."

        "interviewer": "I see. Can you tell me about your experience with Windows Server environments, particularly versions 2012 or 2016? Have you been involved in design, deployment, maintenance, or support of these systems?",
        "candidate": " Sure, I've been primarily involved in the support and maintenance of these systems where throughout UMG research we have approximately 200 Windows servers. Most of these are virtual machine servers which are ran on our VMware infrastructure but some of them were physical and if we ever received any issues relating any of these servers it was my role to fix these issues. These ranged from servers being down to not building up to needing to update packages for software that is used to run the services on the servers and more.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a notably calm and contemplative demeanor, with high levels of concentration and contentment, while also displaying a moderate degree of nostalgia and satisfaction, suggesting a thoughtful and composed approach to the interview question without any significant negative emotions or toxic behaviors.",
        "feedback": "**Accuracy Score: 80%**\n\n**Feedback on Inaccuracies:**\n\n1. **Experience with Windows Server Versions**: The candidate mentions primarily supporting and maintaining approximately 200 Windows servers but does not specify whether these servers are running Windows Server 2012 or 2016, which were the focus of the question. Clarifying the specific versions they worked with would strengthen their response.\n\n2. **Details on Virtual and Physical Servers**: While the candidate notes that most servers are virtual machines running on VMware, they could provide more detail about their experience with both virtual and physical servers. For example, mentioning specific tasks or challenges faced with each type would demonstrate a deeper understanding of the environments.\n\n3. **Types of Issues Resolved**: The candidate lists various issues they resolved but does not provide specific examples or methods used to address these problems. Including details about particular incidents or the troubleshooting steps taken would enhance their answer and showcase their problem-solving skills.\n\n4. **Role in Updates and Maintenance**: The candidate mentions needing to update packages for software but does not elaborate on the process or tools used for these updates.
