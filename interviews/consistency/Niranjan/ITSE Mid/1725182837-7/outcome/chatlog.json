        "interviewer": "Hello! It's nice to meet you too. Thank you for taking the time to speak with me today about the Entry-Level IT Support Engineer role. To start off, could you tell me about your experience with Microsoft Windows, particularly in troubleshooting and resolving issues?",
        "candidate": " Sure, I'd be happy to. Over the last 10 years, I have experienced using Windows throughout these 10 years, maybe having used Windows 7 and then 10. And throughout that time, I've encountered a large amount of issues which I've had to solve. These have ranged from programs crashing, blue screens of death, system freezes, network issues, etc. And this extends into my work experience at G-Research as a technical support engineer, where my role was to deal with our corporate users, again, system crashes and system freezes and any level of technical issue across the entire corporate infrastructure that was related to a technical issue.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a high level of interest (0.465) and calmness (0.316), along with notable levels of satisfaction (0.207) and admiration (0.210), suggesting they were engaged and composed during the interview while also expressing positive sentiments towards the topic or interviewer.",
        "feedback": "The accuracy of the answer provided is 85%.\n\n**Inaccuracies and Feedback:**\n\n1. **Experience Duration**: The candidate states they have \"over the last 10 years\" of experience with Windows. However, they mention using Windows 7 and 10, which suggests they may not have been using Windows for the entire 10 years, as Windows 7 was released in 2009 and Windows 10 in 2015. This could lead to confusion about the actual duration of their experience with each version.\n\n2. **Specificity in Troubleshooting**: While the candidate mentions encountering various issues such as \"programs crashing, blue screens of death, system freezes, network issues,\" they could have provided more specific examples of how they resolved these issues. For instance, mentioning specific troubleshooting steps or tools used would enhance the credibility of their experience.\n\n3. **Role Description**: The candidate mentions their role at G-Research as a technical support engineer but does not elaborate on specific responsibilities or achievements in that role. Providing more detail about their contributions or the types of technical issues they resolved would strengthen their answer.\n\nOverall, the candidate demonstrates relevant experience but could improve by providing clearer details and examples of their troubleshooting process and specific contributions in their previous role."

        "interviewer": "Thank you for sharing that. Could you elaborate on your experience with Active Directory, particularly in areas like security groups, administration, or deployment?",
        "candidate": " Sure. I do have a bit of experience with Active Directory from G-Research where I had to assign and remove certain security groups which gave access to particular features. I've never deployed Active Directory before because that was handled by the corporate infrastructure team that I did work closely with. And general Active Directory administration would be based on what tickets we receive at any point in time via our ticket management system Jiro.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a high level of interest (0.338) and concentration (0.299), coupled with moderate determination (0.193) and calmness (0.136), suggesting they were engaged and focused during the interview, while also displaying some annoyance (0.160) and contemplation (0.113), which could indicate they were processing challenging questions or concepts.",
        "feedback": "**Accuracy Score: 75%**\n\n**Inaccuracies and Feedback:**\n\n1. **Experience with Security Groups**: The candidate mentions assigning and removing security groups but does not elaborate on the specific types of security groups they worked with or the permissions associated with them. Providing more detail about the security groups, such as whether they were used for specific applications or roles, would enhance the answer.\n\n2. **Collaboration with Infrastructure Team**: While the candidate states they worked closely with the corporate infrastructure team for deployment, they do not specify what aspects of Active Directory deployment they were involved in, if any. Clarifying their role in this collaboration would provide a clearer picture of their experience.\n\n3. **Active Directory Administration**: The candidate mentions that general administration is based on tickets received via a ticket management system (Jira). However, they do not provide examples of the types of tickets they handled or the specific administrative tasks they performed. Including specific examples of issues resolved or tasks completed would strengthen their response.\n\nOverall, while the candidate demonstrates some relevant experience with Active Directory, they could improve their answer by providing more specific details about their responsibilities and contributions in relation to security groups and administration tasks."

        "interviewer": "I see. Can you tell me about your experience with Windows Server environments, particularly versions 2012 or 2016? Have you been involved in design, deployment, maintenance, or support of these systems?",
        "candidate": " Sure, I've been primarily involved in the support and maintenance of these systems where throughout UMG research we have approximately 200 Windows servers. Most of these are virtual machine servers which are ran on our VMware infrastructure but some of them were physical and if we ever received any issues relating any of these servers it was my role to fix these issues. These ranged from servers being down to not building up to needing to update packages for software that is used to run the services on the servers and more.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a high level of calmness (0.46) and concentration (0.23), coupled with significant contemplation (0.22) and contentment (0.14), suggesting a composed and thoughtful demeanor during the interview, while also displaying a moderate level of interest (0.13) and satisfaction (0.12) that could be viewed positively in an interview setting.",
