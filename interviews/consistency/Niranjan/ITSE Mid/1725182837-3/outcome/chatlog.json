        "interviewer": "Hello! It's nice to meet you too. Thank you for taking the time to speak with me today about the Entry-Level IT Support Engineer role. To start off, could you tell me about your experience with Microsoft Windows, particularly in troubleshooting and resolving issues?",
        "candidate": " Sure, I'd be happy to. Over the last 10 years, I have experienced using Windows throughout these 10 years, maybe having used Windows 7 and then 10. And throughout that time, I've encountered a large amount of issues which I've had to solve. These have ranged from programs crashing, blue screens of death, system freezes, network issues, etc. And this extends into my work experience at G-Research as a technical support engineer, where my role was to deal with our corporate users, again, system crashes and system freezes and any level of technical issue across the entire corporate infrastructure that was related to a technical issue.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a high level of interest (0.465) and calmness (0.316), along with moderate levels of satisfaction (0.207), admiration (0.210), and contentment (0.168), suggesting they were engaged, composed, and generally positive during this part of the interview, while also displaying a hint of sarcasm (0.126) which could be interpreted as confidence or a more relaxed demeanor.",
        "feedback": "The accuracy of the answer provided is 85%.\n\nFeedback on inaccuracies:\n\n1. **Experience Duration**: The candidate mentioned having \"10 years\" of experience with Windows, but it would be more accurate to specify that they have been using Windows for that duration rather than implying they have been troubleshooting for that long. This could lead to confusion about their actual technical support experience.\n\n2. **Specificity of Issues**: While the candidate listed various issues they encountered (e.g., blue screens of death, system freezes), they could have provided more detail on how they specifically resolved these issues. For example, mentioning specific troubleshooting steps or tools used would enhance the credibility of their experience.\n\n3. **Role Description**: The candidate stated their role at G-Research involved dealing with \"any level of technical issue across the entire corporate infrastructure.\" This is quite broad and could be improved by specifying particular responsibilities or types of issues they handled, which would provide a clearer picture of their expertise.\n\nOverall, the candidate demonstrated relevant experience but could improve by providing more specific examples and clarifying their role in troubleshooting."

        "interviewer": "Thank you for sharing that. Could you elaborate on your experience with Active Directory, particularly in areas like security groups, administration, or deployment?",
        "candidate": " Sure. I do have a bit of experience with Active Directory from G-Research where I had to assign and remove certain security groups which gave access to particular features. I've never deployed Active Directory before because that was handled by the corporate infrastructure team that I did work closely with. And general Active Directory administration would be based on what tickets we receive at any point in time via our ticket management system Jiro.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a high level of interest (0.338) and concentration (0.299), coupled with moderate determination (0.193) and calmness (0.136), suggesting they were engaged and focused during the interview, while also displaying some annoyance (0.160) and contemplation (0.113), which could indicate they were carefully considering their responses or possibly dealing with a challenging question.",
        "feedback": "The accuracy of the answer provided is 75%.\n\nFeedback on inaccuracies:\n\n1. **Experience with Security Groups**: The candidate mentioned assigning and removing security groups but did not elaborate on the specific types of security groups they worked with or the implications of those actions. Providing examples of the types of security groups (e.g., distribution groups, security groups) and the context in which they were used would enhance the answer.\n\n2. **Collaboration with Infrastructure Team**: While the candidate stated they worked closely with the corporate infrastructure team for deployment, they did not specify what aspects of Active Directory deployment they were involved in, if any. Clarifying their role in this collaboration would provide a clearer picture of their experience.\n\n3. **Active Directory Administration**: The candidate mentioned that general administration was based on tickets received via a ticket management system (Jira). However, they did not provide any specific examples of the types of tickets they handled or the issues they resolved. Including specific scenarios would strengthen their response and demonstrate their hands-on experience with Active Directory administration.\n\nOverall, while the candidate has relevant experience, they could improve their answer by providing more specific examples and details regarding their involvement with Active Directory, particularly in security groups and administration."

        "interviewer": "I see. Can you tell me about your experience with Windows Server environments, particularly versions 2012 or 2016? Have you been involved in design, deployment, maintenance, or support of these systems?",
        "candidate": " Sure, I've been primarily involved in the support and maintenance of these systems where throughout UMG research we have approximately 200 Windows servers. Most of these are virtual machine servers which are ran on our VMware infrastructure but some of them were physical and if we ever received any issues relating any of these servers it was my role to fix these issues. These ranged from servers being down to not building up to needing to update packages for software that is used to run the services on the servers and more.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a notably high level of calmness (0.53) and concentration (0.22), along with significant contentment (0.22) and satisfaction (0.20), suggesting a composed and focused demeanor during the interview, while also displaying a moderate level of interest (0.14) and contemplation (0.15), indicating thoughtful engagement with the question at hand.",
        "feedback": "**Accuracy Score: 80%**\n\n**Feedback on Inaccuracies:**\n\n1. **Experience with Windows Server Versions**: The candidate did not specifically mention their experience with Windows Server 2012 or 2016, which was a key part of the question. While they discussed their involvement with Windows servers in general, it would have been more accurate to directly reference their experience with these specific versions.\n\n2. **Role in Design and Deployment**: The candidate focused primarily on support and maintenance but did not mention any involvement in the design or deployment of Windows Server environments. Including any experience in these areas, even if limited, would have provided a more comprehensive view of their capabilities.\n\n3. **Details on Issue Resolution**: While the candidate mentioned fixing various issues, they could have provided more specific examples of the types of problems encountered and the methods used to resolve them. This would enhance the credibility of their experience and demonstrate their problem-solving skills more effectively.\n\n4. **Virtualization Context**: The candidate mentioned that most of the servers are virtual machines running on VMware infrastructure, but they did not elaborate on any specific challenges or experiences related to virtualization. Discussing common virtualization issues or their role in managing virtual environments would have added depth to their answer.\n\nOverall, while the candidate demonstrated relevant experience in supporting Windows servers, they could improve their response by providing more specific details about their experience with the relevant versions, their role in design and deployment, and examples of issue resolution."
