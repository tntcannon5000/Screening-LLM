        "interviewer": "Hello! It's nice to meet you too. Thank you for taking the time to speak with me today about the Entry-Level IT Support Engineer role. To start off, could you tell me about your experience with Microsoft Windows, particularly in troubleshooting and resolving issues?",
        "candidate": " Sure, I'd be happy to. Over the last 10 years, I have experienced using Windows throughout these 10 years, maybe having used Windows 7 and then 10. And throughout that time, I've encountered a large amount of issues which I've had to solve. These have ranged from programs crashing, blue screens of death, system freezes, network issues, etc. And this extends into my work experience at G-Research as a technical support engineer, where my role was to deal with our corporate users, again, system crashes and system freezes and any level of technical issue across the entire corporate infrastructure that was related to a technical issue.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a high level of interest (0.465) and calmness (0.316), coupled with moderate levels of satisfaction (0.207), admiration (0.210), and contentment (0.168), suggesting they were engaged, composed, and positively disposed during this part of the interview, which are generally favorable traits for a successful interview performance.",
        "feedback": "The accuracy of the answer provided is 85%.\n\nFeedback on inaccuracies:\n\n1. **Experience Duration**: The candidate states they have \"over the last 10 years\" of experience with Windows. However, they mention using Windows 7 and 10, which were released in 2009 and 2015, respectively. This could imply that their experience with Windows is not a full 10 years, as Windows 7 would not have been used for the entire duration mentioned. Clarifying the timeline of their experience would improve accuracy.\n\n2. **Specificity of Issues**: While the candidate lists various issues they have encountered (program crashes, blue screens of death, system freezes, network issues), they could enhance their response by providing specific examples or methods they used to troubleshoot these issues. This would demonstrate a deeper understanding and practical experience in resolving such problems.\n\n3. **Role Description**: The candidate mentions their role at G-Research as a technical support engineer but does not elaborate on specific tools or techniques they used to resolve issues. Including this information would provide a clearer picture of their hands-on experience and problem-solving skills.\n\nOverall, the candidate's response is generally strong, but addressing these points would enhance the clarity and depth of their experience with Microsoft Windows troubleshooting."

        "interviewer": "Thank you for sharing that. Could you elaborate on your experience with Active Directory, particularly in areas like security groups, administration, or deployment?",
        "candidate": " Sure. I do have a bit of experience with Active Directory from G-Research where I had to assign and remove certain security groups which gave access to particular features. I've never deployed Active Directory before because that was handled by the corporate infrastructure team that I did work closely with. And general Active Directory administration would be based on what tickets we receive at any point in time via our ticket management system Jiro.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a high level of interest (0.338) and concentration (0.299), coupled with moderate determination (0.193) and calmness (0.136), suggesting they were engaged and focused during the interview, while also displaying some annoyance (0.160) and contemplation (0.113), which could indicate they were carefully considering their responses or potentially dealing with a challenging question.",
        "feedback": "The accuracy of the answer provided is 75%.\n\nFeedback on inaccuracies:\n\n1. **Experience with Security Groups**: The candidate mentions assigning and removing security groups but does not elaborate on the specific types of security groups they worked with or the permissions associated with them. Providing more detail about the types of security groups (e.g., whether they were security or distribution groups) and the context in which they were used would enhance the response.\n\n2. **Collaboration with Infrastructure Team**: While the candidate states they worked closely with the corporate infrastructure team for deployment, they do not mention any specific interactions or contributions they made during that process. Including examples of how they collaborated or any insights gained from that experience would strengthen their answer.\n\n3. **Active Directory Administration**: The candidate mentions that general administration is based on tickets received via a ticket management system (Jira). However, they do not provide any examples of the types of tickets they handled or the specific administrative tasks they performed. Including specific examples of issues they resolved or tasks they completed would demonstrate a more comprehensive understanding of Active Directory administration.\n\nOverall, while the candidate provides a basic overview of their experience with Active Directory, adding more specific details and examples would improve the depth and clarity of their response."

        "interviewer": "I see. Can you tell me about your experience with Windows Server environments, particularly versions 2012 or 2016? Have you been involved in design, deployment, maintenance, or support of these systems?",
        "candidate": " Sure, I've been primarily involved in the support and maintenance of these systems where throughout UMG research we have approximately 200 Windows servers. Most of these are virtual machine servers which are ran on our VMware infrastructure but some of them were physical and if we ever received any issues relating any of these servers it was my role to fix these issues. These ranged from servers being down to not building up to needing to update packages for software that is used to run the services on the servers and more.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a high level of calmness (0.46) and concentration (0.23), coupled with notable levels of contemplation (0.22) and contentment (0.14), suggesting a composed and thoughtful demeanor during the interview, while also displaying a moderate degree of interest (0.13) and satisfaction (0.12) that indicates engagement with the topic at hand.",
        "feedback": "**Accuracy Score: 80%**\n\n**Feedback on Inaccuracies:**\n\n1. **Experience with Windows Server Versions**: The candidate mentions primarily supporting and maintaining Windows servers but does not specify their experience with Windows Server 2012 or 2016 directly. It would enhance the response to explicitly state their familiarity with these specific versions, as the question specifically inquired about them.\n\n2. **Details on Virtual and Physical Servers**: While the candidate notes that most servers are virtual machines on VMware infrastructure, they could provide more detail about their experience with both virtual and physical servers. For instance, mentioning any specific challenges faced or solutions implemented for either type would demonstrate a deeper understanding of the environments.\n\n3. **Types of Issues Resolved**: The candidate lists various issues they resolved but does not provide specific examples or context for these problems. Including particular instances of server downtime or software updates would illustrate their hands-on experience and problem-solving skills more effectively.\n\n4. **Role in the Team**: The candidate states it was their role to fix issues but does not elaborate on the processes or tools they used to diagnose and resolve these issues. Providing insight into their troubleshooting methodology or any tools they utilized would strengthen their response.\n\nOverall, while the candidate provides a general overview of their experience with Windows Server environments, adding more specific details and examples would improve the clarity and depth of their response."

        "interviewer": "Thank you for that information. Lastly, could you describe your experience with networking, particularly in areas like VLAN configuration, routing, switching, or troubleshooting TCP/IP issues?",
        "candidate": " Sure, I have some experience troubleshooting these. Our infrastructure was based on Cisco architecture, so we made use of Cisco Tracer to try to solve any issues that we were provided with.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a high level of annoyance (0.557) and determination (0.211), along with moderate levels of concentration (0.184) and disapproval (0.122), suggesting they were focused but potentially frustrated or dissatisfied with the topic or situation, while maintaining a generally neutral sentiment (0.675 in sentiment level 5) and showing no significant signs of toxicity.",
        "feedback": "**Accuracy Score: 70%**\n\n**Feedback on Inaccuracies:**\n\n1. **Specificity of Tools Used**: The candidate mentions using \"Cisco Tracer\" for troubleshooting but does not specify the exact tools or commands they utilized within the Cisco architecture. It would enhance their response to mention specific tools like CiscoView or the Internetwork Performance Monitor (IPM), which are commonly used for troubleshooting and monitoring network issues.\n\n2. **Depth of Experience**: The candidate states they have \"some experience troubleshooting these\" but does not provide specific examples of the types of issues they encountered or how they resolved them. Including particular instances of VLAN configuration, routing, switching, or TCP/IP troubleshooting would demonstrate a more comprehensive understanding of their experience.\n\n3. **Lack of Detail on Networking Concepts**: The answer lacks detail on the candidate's understanding of VLAN configuration, routing, switching, or TCP/IP issues. Providing insights into their knowledge of these concepts or any relevant projects they worked on would strengthen their response.\n\n4. **Generalization of Experience**: The candidate's response is somewhat vague and does not convey a strong sense of their hands-on experience with networking. More specific examples or scenarios where they applied their troubleshooting skills would provide a clearer picture of their capabilities.\n\nOverall, while the candidate provides a basic overview of their experience with networking, adding more specific details and examples would improve the clarity and depth of their response."
