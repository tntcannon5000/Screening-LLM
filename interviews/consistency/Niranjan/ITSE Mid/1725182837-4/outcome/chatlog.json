        "interviewer": "Hello! It's nice to meet you too. Thank you for taking the time to speak with me today about the Entry-Level IT Support Engineer role. To start off, could you tell me about your experience with Microsoft Windows, particularly in troubleshooting and resolving issues?",
        "candidate": " Sure, I'd be happy to. Over the last 10 years, I have experienced using Windows throughout these 10 years, maybe having used Windows 7 and then 10. And throughout that time, I've encountered a large amount of issues which I've had to solve. These have ranged from programs crashing, blue screens of death, system freezes, network issues, etc. And this extends into my work experience at G-Research as a technical support engineer, where my role was to deal with our corporate users, again, system crashes and system freezes and any level of technical issue across the entire corporate infrastructure that was related to a technical issue.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a high level of interest (0.465) and calmness (0.316), coupled with moderate levels of satisfaction (0.207), admiration (0.210), and contentment (0.168), suggesting they were engaged, composed, and generally positive during this part of the interview, which are favorable traits for a successful interview performance.",
        "feedback": "The accuracy of the answer provided is 85%.\n\nFeedback on inaccuracies:\n\n1. **Experience Duration**: The candidate mentioned having \"10 years\" of experience with Windows, but it would be more accurate to specify that they have been using Windows for that duration rather than implying they have been troubleshooting for that long. This could lead to confusion about their actual technical support experience.\n\n2. **Specificity of Issues**: While the candidate listed various issues they encountered (e.g., blue screens of death, system freezes), they could have provided more detail on how they specifically resolved these issues. For example, mentioning specific troubleshooting steps or tools used would enhance the credibility of their experience.\n\n3. **Role Description**: The candidate stated their role at G-Research involved dealing with \"any level of technical issue across the entire corporate infrastructure.\" This is quite broad and could benefit from more specificity regarding the types of issues they handled and the technologies they worked with.\n\nOverall, the candidate demonstrated relevant experience but could improve by providing more specific examples and clarifying their role in troubleshooting."

        "interviewer": "Thank you for sharing that. Could you elaborate on your experience with Active Directory, particularly in areas like security groups, administration, or deployment?",
        "candidate": " Sure. I do have a bit of experience with Active Directory from G-Research where I had to assign and remove certain security groups which gave access to particular features. I've never deployed Active Directory before because that was handled by the corporate infrastructure team that I did work closely with. And general Active Directory administration would be based on what tickets we receive at any point in time via our ticket management system Jiro.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a high level of interest (0.334) and concentration (0.246), balanced with moderate levels of annoyance (0.227) and determination (0.123), suggesting they were engaged but potentially challenged or frustrated by the question, while maintaining a generally neutral emotional state as indicated by the mid-range sentiment scores.",
        "feedback": "The accuracy of the answer provided is 75%.\n\nFeedback on inaccuracies:\n\n1. **Experience with Security Groups**: The candidate mentioned assigning and removing security groups but did not elaborate on the specific types of security groups they worked with or the criteria for assigning users to these groups. Providing more detail about the types of security groups (e.g., distribution vs. security groups) and their purposes would enhance the response.\n\n2. **Collaboration with Infrastructure Team**: While the candidate stated they worked closely with the corporate infrastructure team for deployment, they did not mention any specific interactions or contributions they made during that process. Including examples of how they collaborated or any insights gained from that experience would strengthen their answer.\n\n3. **Active Directory Administration**: The candidate mentioned that general administration was based on tickets received via a ticket management system (Jira). However, they did not provide examples of the types of tickets they handled or the specific administrative tasks they performed. More detail on their responsibilities and the nature of the issues they resolved would improve the clarity of their experience.\n\nOverall, while the candidate demonstrated some relevant experience with Active Directory, they could improve their response by providing more specific examples and details regarding their roles and responsibilities."

        "interviewer": "I see. Can you tell me about your experience with Windows Server environments, particularly versions 2012 or 2016? Have you been involved in design, deployment, maintenance, or support of these systems?",
        "candidate": " Sure, I've been primarily involved in the support and maintenance of these systems where throughout UMG research we have approximately 200 Windows servers. Most of these are virtual machine servers which are ran on our VMware infrastructure but some of them were physical and if we ever received any issues relating any of these servers it was my role to fix these issues. These ranged from servers being down to not building up to needing to update packages for software that is used to run the services on the servers and more.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a predominantly calm and contemplative demeanor, with notable levels of concentration and contentment, while also displaying moderate interest and satisfaction, suggesting a composed and thoughtful approach to the interview question without any significant negative emotions or toxic behaviors.",
        "feedback": "**Accuracy Score: 80%**\n\n**Feedback on inaccuracies:**\n\n1. **Experience with Windows Server Versions**: The candidate did not specify their experience with Windows Server 2012 or 2016 directly. While they mentioned supporting approximately 200 Windows servers, it would have been beneficial to clarify whether these servers included the specified versions and to what extent they were involved with them.\n\n2. **Role in Design and Deployment**: The candidate focused primarily on support and maintenance but did not mention any involvement in the design or deployment of Windows Server environments. Including any experience or knowledge in these areas would have provided a more comprehensive view of their capabilities.\n\n3. **Specific Issues Resolved**: While the candidate mentioned fixing issues related to servers being down and needing updates, they could have provided more specific examples of the types of problems encountered and the solutions implemented. This would enhance the credibility of their experience and demonstrate their problem-solving skills.\n\n4. **Virtual vs. Physical Servers**: The candidate mentioned that most servers were virtual machines on VMware infrastructure, but they did not elaborate on any specific challenges or experiences related to managing virtual servers versus physical ones. Providing insights into the differences in handling these environments would have added depth to their answer.\n\nOverall, while the candidate demonstrated relevant experience in supporting Windows servers, they could improve their response by providing more specific examples and clarifying their involvement in various aspects of Windows Server environments."

        "interviewer": "Thank you for that information. Lastly, could you describe your experience with networking, particularly in areas like VLAN configuration, routing, switching, or troubleshooting TCP/IP issues?",
        "candidate": " Sure, I have some experience troubleshooting these. Our infrastructure was based on Cisco architecture, so we made use of Cisco Tracer to try to solve any issues that we were provided with.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a high level of annoyance (0.557) and determination (0.211), coupled with moderate levels of concentration (0.184) and disapproval (0.122), suggesting they were focused but potentially frustrated or displeased with the topic or situation at hand, while maintaining a relatively neutral overall sentiment (0.675 in sentiment level 5).",
        "feedback": "**Accuracy Score: 70%**\n\n**Feedback on inaccuracies:**\n\n1. **Experience with Networking Tools**: The candidate mentioned using \"Cisco Tracer\" for troubleshooting, but this is not a widely recognized tool. It would be more accurate to refer to tools like CiscoView or the Internetwork Performance Monitor (IPM) for monitoring and troubleshooting network issues. This lack of specificity may lead to confusion about the candidate's actual experience with Cisco tools.\n\n2. **Depth of Experience**: The candidate stated they have \"some experience troubleshooting these\" but did not elaborate on specific scenarios or types of issues they encountered while troubleshooting VLANs, routing, switching, or TCP/IP issues. Providing concrete examples of problems faced and how they were resolved would enhance the credibility of their experience.\n\n3. **Scope of Troubleshooting**: The answer lacks detail regarding the types of networking issues they have dealt with, such as specific VLAN configurations, routing protocols, or switching problems. More information on the nature of the troubleshooting tasks performed would provide a clearer picture of their expertise in networking.\n\n4. **Collaboration and Teamwork**: The candidate did not mention any collaboration with other team members or departments during troubleshooting processes. Including examples of teamwork or communication with other IT staff would demonstrate their ability to work in a collaborative environment.\n\nOverall, while the candidate has some experience in networking, the response could be improved by providing more specific examples and clarifying their familiarity with recognized networking tools and practices."
