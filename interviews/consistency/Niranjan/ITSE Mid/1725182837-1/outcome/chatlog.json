        "interviewer": "Hello! It's nice to meet you too. Thank you for taking the time to speak with me today about the Entry-Level IT Support Engineer role. To start off, could you tell me about your experience with Microsoft Windows, particularly in troubleshooting and resolving issues?",
        "candidate": " Sure, I'd be happy to. Over the last 10 years, I have experienced using Windows throughout these 10 years, maybe having used Windows 7 and then 10. And throughout that time, I've encountered a large amount of issues which I've had to solve. These have ranged from programs crashing, blue screens of death, system freezes, network issues, etc. And this extends into my work experience at G-Research as a technical support engineer, where my role was to deal with our corporate users, again, system crashes and system freezes and any level of technical issue across the entire corporate infrastructure that was related to a technical issue.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a high level of interest (0.465) and calmness (0.316), coupled with moderate levels of satisfaction (0.207), admiration (0.210), and contentment (0.168), suggesting they were engaged, composed, and generally positive during this part of the interview, which are favorable traits for a successful interview performance.",
        "feedback": "The accuracy of the answer provided is 85%.\n\nFeedback on inaccuracies:\n\n1. **Experience Duration**: The candidate mentioned having \"10 years\" of experience with Windows, but it would be more accurate to specify that they have been using Windows for that duration rather than implying they have been troubleshooting for that long. This could lead to confusion about the depth of their troubleshooting experience.\n\n2. **Specificity of Issues**: While the candidate listed various issues they encountered (e.g., blue screens of death, system freezes), they could have provided more detail on how they resolved these issues. For example, mentioning specific troubleshooting steps or tools used would enhance the credibility of their experience.\n\n3. **Role Description**: The candidate stated their role at G-Research involved dealing with \"any level of technical issue across the entire corporate infrastructure.\" This is quite broad and could be improved by specifying particular types of issues they handled or the systems they worked with, which would provide a clearer picture of their expertise.\n\nOverall, the candidate demonstrated relevant experience but could improve by providing more specific examples and clarifying their role in troubleshooting."

        "interviewer": "Thank you for sharing that. Could you elaborate on your experience with Active Directory, particularly in areas like security groups, administration, or deployment?",
        "candidate": " Sure. I do have a bit of experience with Active Directory from G-Research where I had to assign and remove certain security groups which gave access to particular features. I've never deployed Active Directory before because that was handled by the corporate infrastructure team that I did work closely with. And general Active Directory administration would be based on what tickets we receive at any point in time via our ticket management system Jiro.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a high level of interest (0.344) and concentration (0.254), coupled with moderate levels of determination (0.187) and contemplation (0.133), suggesting they were engaged and thoughtful in their answer, while also displaying some annoyance (0.161) and disappointment (0.062), which could indicate they were grappling with a challenging topic or situation during the interview.",
        "feedback": "The accuracy of the answer provided is 75%.\n\nFeedback on inaccuracies:\n\n1. **Experience with Security Groups**: The candidate mentioned assigning and removing security groups but did not elaborate on the specific types of security groups they worked with or the implications of those actions. Providing examples of how these security groups impacted user access or security would enhance the response.\n\n2. **Collaboration with Infrastructure Team**: While the candidate stated they worked closely with the corporate infrastructure team for deployment, they did not mention any specific interactions or contributions they made during that process. Detailing their role in collaboration would provide a clearer picture of their involvement.\n\n3. **Active Directory Administration**: The candidate mentioned that general administration was based on tickets received via a ticket management system (Jira). However, they did not specify the types of tickets they handled or any particular administrative tasks they performed. Including specific examples of issues they resolved or tasks they completed would strengthen their answer.\n\nOverall, while the candidate demonstrated some relevant experience with Active Directory, they could improve their response by providing more specific examples and details about their roles and responsibilities."

        "interviewer": "I see. Can you tell me about your experience with Windows Server environments, particularly versions 2012 or 2016? Have you been involved in design, deployment, maintenance, or support of these systems?",
        "candidate": " Sure, I've been primarily involved in the support and maintenance of these systems where throughout UMG research we have approximately 200 Windows servers. Most of these are virtual machine servers which are ran on our VMware infrastructure but some of them were physical and if we ever received any issues relating any of these servers it was my role to fix these issues. These ranged from servers being down to not building up to needing to update packages for software that is used to run the services on the servers and more.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a high level of calmness (0.46) and concentration (0.24), along with notable levels of contemplation (0.22) and interest (0.13), suggesting a composed and engaged demeanor during the interview, while also displaying some contentment (0.12) and satisfaction (0.10), which are generally positive traits in an interview setting.",
        "feedback": "The accuracy of the answer provided is 80%.\n\nFeedback on inaccuracies:\n\n1. **Experience with Windows Server Versions**: The candidate did not specify their experience with Windows Server 2012 or 2016 directly, which was the focus of the question. While they mentioned supporting approximately 200 Windows servers, they should have clarified that these included both versions to align with the question.\n\n2. **Role in Design and Deployment**: The candidate primarily discussed support and maintenance but did not mention any involvement in the design or deployment of Windows Server environments. Including any experience in these areas, even if limited, would have provided a more comprehensive view of their capabilities.\n\n3. **Specific Issues Resolved**: While the candidate mentioned fixing various issues, they could have provided more specific examples of the types of problems encountered and the solutions implemented. This would enhance the credibility of their experience and demonstrate their problem-solving skills.\n\n4. **Virtual vs. Physical Servers**: The candidate mentioned that most servers were virtual machines but did not elaborate on any differences in handling issues between virtual and physical servers. Providing insights into their experience with both types would have added depth to their answer.\n\nOverall, while the candidate demonstrated relevant experience in supporting Windows Server environments, they could improve their response by providing more specific details and addressing the aspects of design and deployment."

        "interviewer": "Thank you for that information. Lastly, could you describe your experience with networking, particularly in areas like VLAN configuration, routing, switching, or troubleshooting TCP/IP issues?",
        "candidate": " Sure, I have some experience troubleshooting these. Our infrastructure was based on Cisco architecture, so we made use of Cisco Tracer to try to solve any issues that we were provided with.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a high level of annoyance (0.568) and moderate levels of concentration (0.178) and determination (0.173), suggesting they were focused but irritated during the interview, while also displaying some disapproval (0.125) and contempt (0.085), which could be concerning traits in a professional setting.",
        "feedback": "The accuracy of the answer provided is 70%.\n\nFeedback on inaccuracies:\n\n1. **Experience with Networking Tools**: The candidate mentioned using \"Cisco Tracer\" for troubleshooting, but this term is not widely recognized in the context of Cisco tools. It is likely a transcription error, and they may have meant \"Cisco Trace\" or another Cisco troubleshooting tool. This lack of clarity could lead to confusion about their actual experience with Cisco's networking tools.\n\n2. **Depth of Experience**: The candidate stated they have \"some experience troubleshooting these,\" but did not provide specific examples of issues they encountered or how they resolved them. Including specific scenarios or challenges faced would enhance the credibility of their experience.\n\n3. **Areas of Networking**: The candidate did not address VLAN configuration, routing, or switching in their response, which were part of the original question. While they mentioned troubleshooting, they could have elaborated on their experience in these specific areas to provide a more comprehensive answer.\n\n4. **Tools and Techniques**: The answer lacks mention of other common networking troubleshooting tools or techniques, such as ping, traceroute, or network management systems, which are essential for effective troubleshooting in networking environments. Including these would demonstrate a broader understanding of networking practices.\n\nOverall, while the candidate demonstrated some familiarity with troubleshooting in a Cisco environment, they could improve their response by providing more specific examples and addressing the various areas of networking mentioned in the question."
