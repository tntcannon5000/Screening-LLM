        "interviewer": "Hello! It's nice to meet you too. Thank you for taking the time to speak with me today about the Entry-Level IT Support Engineer role. To start off, could you tell me about your experience with Microsoft Windows, particularly in troubleshooting and resolving issues?",
        "candidate": " Sure, I'd be happy to. Over the last 10 years, I have experienced using Windows throughout these 10 years, maybe having used Windows 7 and then 10. And throughout that time, I've encountered a large amount of issues which I've had to solve. These have ranged from programs crashing, blue screens of death, system freezes, network issues, etc. And this extends into my work experience at G-Research as a technical support engineer, where my role was to deal with our corporate users, again, system crashes and system freezes and any level of technical issue across the entire corporate infrastructure that was related to a technical issue.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a high level of interest (0.465) and calmness (0.316), along with moderate levels of satisfaction (0.207), admiration (0.210), and contentment (0.168), suggesting they were engaged, composed, and generally positive during this part of the interview, while also displaying a hint of sarcasm (0.126) which could indicate confidence or a more relaxed demeanor.",
        "feedback": "The accuracy of the answer provided is 85%.\n\nFeedback:\n1. The candidate mentioned having \"experienced using Windows throughout these 10 years,\" which could be more clearly articulated as having \"extensive experience\" with Windows operating systems. This phrasing would better convey their proficiency.\n2. The candidate listed various issues they encountered, such as \"programs crashing, blue screens of death, system freezes, network issues, etc.\" While this is relevant, it would strengthen their response to include specific troubleshooting methods or tools they used to resolve these issues, as this demonstrates practical knowledge and problem-solving skills.\n3. The mention of their role at G-Research is relevant, but it could be enhanced by providing specific examples of how they resolved issues or any particular achievements in that role. This would give a clearer picture of their hands-on experience and effectiveness in a technical support capacity. \n\nOverall, the candidate's experience is relevant, but providing more detail on their troubleshooting methods and specific examples would improve the response."

        "interviewer": "Thank you for sharing that. Could you elaborate on your experience with Active Directory, particularly in areas like security groups, administration, or deployment?",
        "candidate": " Sure. I do have a bit of experience with Active Directory from G-Research where I had to assign and remove certain security groups which gave access to particular features. I've never deployed Active Directory before because that was handled by the corporate infrastructure team that I did work closely with. And general Active Directory administration would be based on what tickets we receive at any point in time via our ticket management system Jiro.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a high level of interest (0.338) and concentration (0.299), coupled with moderate determination (0.193) and calmness (0.136), suggesting they were engaged and focused during the interview, while also displaying some annoyance (0.160) and contemplation (0.113), which could indicate they were carefully considering their responses or potentially struggling with certain aspects of the question.",
        "feedback": "The accuracy of the answer provided is 75%.\n\nFeedback:\n1. The candidate mentioned their experience with assigning and removing security groups, which is relevant. However, they could have elaborated on the specific types of security groups they worked with and the permissions associated with them. This would demonstrate a deeper understanding of Active Directory group management.\n\n2. The candidate stated that they had never deployed Active Directory because it was handled by the corporate infrastructure team. While this is acceptable, it would be beneficial to mention any involvement they had in the deployment process, such as collaborating with the infrastructure team or understanding the deployment strategy. This would show a more proactive approach and familiarity with the deployment process.\n\n3. The mention of using a ticket management system (Jira) for general Active Directory administration is relevant, but the candidate could have provided examples of the types of tickets they handled. This would give a clearer picture of their hands-on experience and the specific tasks they performed related to Active Directory administration.\n\nOverall, while the candidate's experience is relevant, providing more detail on their specific responsibilities and examples of their work would improve the response."

        "interviewer": "I see. Can you tell me about your experience with Windows Server environments, particularly versions 2012 or 2016? Have you been involved in design, deployment, maintenance, or support of these systems?",
        "candidate": " Sure, I've been primarily involved in the support and maintenance of these systems where throughout UMG research we have approximately 200 Windows servers. Most of these are virtual machine servers which are ran on our VMware infrastructure but some of them were physical and if we ever received any issues relating any of these servers it was my role to fix these issues. These ranged from servers being down to not building up to needing to update packages for software that is used to run the services on the servers and more.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a high level of calmness (0.53) and concentration (0.22), coupled with moderate levels of contentment (0.22) and satisfaction (0.20), suggesting a composed and focused demeanor during the interview, while also displaying a neutral sentiment (0.93 in category 5) and very low toxicity scores, which are all positive indicators for a successful interview performance.",
        "feedback": "**Accuracy Score: 80%**\n\n**Feedback:**\n\n1. The candidate mentioned being \"primarily involved in the support and maintenance\" of approximately 200 Windows servers, which is relevant. However, they could have provided more detail about specific tasks they performed during maintenance, such as monitoring server performance, applying updates, or troubleshooting specific issues. This would demonstrate a deeper understanding of the maintenance process.\n\n2. The candidate stated that most of the servers are virtual machines running on VMware infrastructure, which is a good detail. However, they could have elaborated on their experience with VMware tools or any specific challenges they faced while managing virtual servers. This would enhance their credibility in handling virtual environments.\n\n3. The answer mentions a range of issues encountered, such as servers being down or needing updates. While this is relevant, it would strengthen the response to include specific examples of how they resolved these issues or any tools they used for troubleshooting. This would provide a clearer picture of their problem-solving skills and hands-on experience.\n\n4. The candidate did not mention any experience with design or deployment of Windows Server environments, which was part of the original question. While they focused on support and maintenance, acknowledging any exposure to design or deployment, even if limited, would have provided a more comprehensive view of their experience.\n\nOverall, while the candidate's experience is relevant, providing more detail on specific tasks, challenges faced, and examples of problem resolution would improve the response."

        "interviewer": "Thank you for that information. Lastly, could you describe your experience with networking, particularly in areas like VLAN configuration, routing, switching, or troubleshooting TCP/IP issues?",
        "candidate": " Sure, I have some experience troubleshooting these. Our infrastructure was based on Cisco architecture, so we made use of Cisco Tracer to try to solve any issues that we were provided with.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a high level of annoyance (0.557) and determination (0.211), coupled with moderate levels of concentration (0.184) and disapproval (0.122), suggesting they were focused but frustrated during this part of the interview, potentially indicating a challenging or contentious topic was being discussed.",
        "feedback": "**Accuracy Score: 70%**\n\n**Feedback:**\n\n1. The candidate mentioned using \"Cisco Tracer\" for troubleshooting, which appears to be a transcription error. The correct term is likely \"Cisco Packet Tracer,\" a network simulation tool. This should not be counted against the candidate's knowledge.\n\n2. The answer lacks specific details about their experience with VLAN configuration, routing, switching, or TCP/IP troubleshooting. While they mentioned troubleshooting, they did not provide examples of the types of issues they encountered or the methods they used to resolve them. Including specific scenarios or tools used would demonstrate a deeper understanding of networking concepts.\n\n3. The candidate did not mention any specific protocols or technologies related to VLANs, routing, or switching, which are critical areas in networking. Providing examples of their experience in these areas would enhance their response and show a broader knowledge base.\n\n4. The answer could benefit from mentioning any collaborative efforts with other teams or departments when troubleshooting network issues, as this would illustrate their ability to work in a team environment and communicate effectively.\n\nOverall, while the candidate has some experience in troubleshooting, the response would be stronger with more specific examples and details related to the areas mentioned in the question."
