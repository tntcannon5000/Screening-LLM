        "interviewer": "Hello! It's nice to meet you too. Thank you for taking the time to speak with me today about the Entry-Level IT Support Engineer position. To start off, could you tell me about your experience with Microsoft Windows, particularly in troubleshooting and resolving issues?",
        "candidate": " Yeah sure, I'd be happy to. I've got about 10 years experience working with Windows. This has ranged from me using Windows 7 all the way up to Windows 11 now. In the context of my current work experience at GeoResearch, I've mostly made use of Windows 10 and 10 Server. Some of the issues that we've had to troubleshoot have ranged from Windows blue-screening to software freezing, to network issues with network adapters and a large variety of other things. I mean, it's Windows, so there is a large amount of things that can go wrong. And if it was related to Windows or any sort of technical issue, it was our and therefore my job to help resolve it for our clients.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a high level of interest (0.53) and calmness (0.41), along with moderate levels of enthusiasm (0.19) and contentment (0.11), suggesting they were engaged and composed during the interview, while also displaying a generally positive sentiment (high scores in 7-9 range) and minimal signs of toxicity, which are all favorable traits for a successful interview performance.",
        "feedback": "The accuracy of the answer provided is 85%.\n\nFeedback:\n1. The candidate mentioned having \"about 10 years experience working with Windows,\" which is a strong point. However, it would be beneficial to specify the types of troubleshooting methods or tools they used, as this would provide a clearer picture of their technical skills.\n2. The candidate stated they have experience with \"Windows 10 and 10 Server.\" It should be noted that the correct terminology is \"Windows Server 2016/2019/2022\" (depending on the version) rather than \"10 Server.\" This could lead to confusion regarding their experience with server operating systems.\n3. The candidate described various issues they have encountered, such as blue screens and software freezing, which is relevant. However, they could enhance their response by briefly explaining how they resolved these issues or the steps they took during troubleshooting, which would demonstrate their problem-solving skills more effectively. \n\nOverall, the candidate's experience is relevant, but providing more specific examples of troubleshooting methods and clarifying the server terminology would strengthen their response."

        "interviewer": "Thank you for sharing that information. Could you tell me about your experience with Active Directory, particularly in areas such as security groups, administration, deployment, LDAP, or ADSI?",
        "candidate": " Yeah, of course we're happy to. The majority of my experience comes with administration of Active Directory. So I've been responsible for the general day-to-day AD administration, so user and computer account management, enforcing password policies, resetting password policies and generating randomly generated passwords for user resets, and then providing it directly to them, as well as using Active Directory administrative center as well for managing the directory. I've then also been responsible for applying new role-based access control and utilizing PowerShell to automate some of these things as well.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a high level of determination and concentration, coupled with moderate levels of satisfaction and calmness, suggesting a focused and composed demeanor during the interview, while also showing signs of contemplation and realization, which could indicate thoughtful and insightful responses to the interviewer's questions.",
        "feedback": "The accuracy of the answer provided is 80%.\n\nFeedback:\n1. The candidate mentioned their experience with \"general day-to-day AD administration,\" which is relevant. However, they could enhance their response by providing specific examples of tasks they performed related to security groups and deployment, as these areas were specifically mentioned in the question.\n2. The candidate discussed using PowerShell to automate tasks, which is a strong point. However, they did not elaborate on the specific tasks they automated or how this improved efficiency, which would provide a clearer picture of their technical skills and experience.\n3. While the candidate mentioned enforcing password policies and resetting passwords, they did not discuss any specific security measures or best practices they followed in relation to Active Directory security, which is a critical aspect of AD management.\n4. The answer could benefit from mentioning any experience with LDAP or ADSI, as these were also part of the original question. Including this information would demonstrate a broader understanding of Active Directory and its components.\n\nOverall, while the candidate's experience is relevant, providing more specific examples and addressing all areas mentioned in the question would strengthen their response."

        "interviewer": "I see. Can you describe your experience with networking, particularly in areas like VLAN configuration, routing, switching, and TCP/IP troubleshooting?",
        "candidate": " Sure. I've made use of primarily Cisco packet tracer when it comes to resolving a lot of the internal issues that you research that we had when it comes to networking. So I use this for simulating network environments. I also made use of Wireshark for network traffic analysis. So a lot of the issues that we would encounter would be stuff like misconfigured TCP, TCP IP setups. So I've had to troubleshoot these connectivity problems. I've had to troubleshoot slow network performance, application layer issues and a few other things. It's been quite interesting learning about all these tools and stuff. I've also made use of additional tools from a command line such as ping, traceroute, netstabbed and TCP dump to get an additional deeper level of insight into the issues, which I've quite enjoyed and definitely looking forward to learning more in this area.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited high levels of concentration (0.572) and determination (0.355), coupled with moderate levels of calmness (0.212) and contentment (0.137), suggesting a focused and composed demeanor during the interview, while also displaying enthusiasm (0.187) and interest (0.173) in the topic at hand, which are generally positive traits in an interview setting.",

        "interviewer": "Thank you for sharing that information. Lastly, could you tell me about your experience with PowerShell, particularly in relation to tasks like backups, Azure, or EMC?",
        "candidate": " Of course, I've used Azure, mainly PowerShell. When it comes to PowerShell, I've used it to handle the deployment of Windows-based laptops that we use internally in the company. We used it for the automatic onboarding experience, such that when a user sets up their laptop, the PowerShell script that manages the actual onboarding itself would pre-install a large amount of the apps that we have our clients use. Namely, these included remote PC, so that they could access their server-based workstations in our data center. I've also made use of PowerShell for setting up and configuring Windows Server workstations using Hyper-V. Then I've also made use of Azure for Azure's Active Directory Synchronization ability, and a lot of our permissions management for our Internet-enabled network as well.",
