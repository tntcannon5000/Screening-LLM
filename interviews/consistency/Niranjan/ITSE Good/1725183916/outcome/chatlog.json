        "interviewer": "Hello! It's nice to meet you too. Thank you for taking the time to speak with me today about the Entry-Level IT Support Engineer position. To start off, could you tell me about your experience with Microsoft Windows, particularly in troubleshooting and resolving issues?",
        "candidate": " Yeah sure, I'd be happy to. I've got about 10 years experience working with Windows. This has ranged from me using Windows 7 all the way up to Windows 11 now. In the context of my current work experience at GeoResearch, I've mostly made use of Windows 10 and 10 Server. Some of the issues that we've had to troubleshoot have ranged from Windows blue-screening to software freezing, to network issues with network adapters and a large variety of other things. I mean, it's Windows, so there is a large amount of things that can go wrong. And if it was related to Windows or any sort of technical issue, it was our and therefore my job to help resolve it for our clients.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a high level of interest (0.53) and calmness (0.41), coupled with moderate levels of enthusiasm (0.19) and contentment (0.11), suggesting they were engaged and composed during the interview, while also displaying a positive sentiment (high scores in 7-9 range) and minimal signs of toxicity, indicating a professional and appropriate demeanor.",
        "feedback": "The accuracy of the answer provided is 85%.\n\nFeedback on inaccuracies:\n1. The candidate mentioned having \"about 10 years experience working with Windows,\" which is a strong claim. However, it would be beneficial to specify the nature of their experience (e.g., whether it was in a professional setting, personal use, etc.) to provide more context.\n2. The candidate stated they have worked with \"Windows 10 and 10 Server.\" The correct terminology is \"Windows Server 2016/2019/2022\" (depending on the version) rather than \"10 Server.\" This could lead to confusion regarding the specific server version they are familiar with.\n3. While the candidate mentioned troubleshooting a variety of issues, they could have elaborated on specific troubleshooting steps or tools they used, which would demonstrate a deeper understanding of the troubleshooting process.\n\nOverall, the candidate's experience is relevant, but providing more specific details would enhance the clarity and depth of their response."

        "interviewer": "Thank you for sharing that information. Could you tell me about your experience with Active Directory, particularly in areas such as security groups, administration, deployment, LDAP, or ADSI?",
        "candidate": " Yeah, of course we're happy to. The majority of my experience comes with administration of Active Directory. So I've been responsible for the general day-to-day AD administration, so user and computer account management, enforcing password policies, resetting password policies and generating randomly generated passwords for user resets, and then providing it directly to them, as well as using Active Directory administrative center as well for managing the directory. I've then also been responsible for applying new role-based access control and utilizing PowerShell to automate some of these things as well.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a high level of determination (0.45) and concentration (0.38), coupled with moderate levels of calmness (0.22) and satisfaction (0.22), suggesting a focused and composed demeanor during the interview, while also displaying some contemplation (0.12) and realization (0.13), which could indicate thoughtful and insightful responses to the interviewer's questions.",
        "feedback": "The accuracy of the answer provided is 90%.\n\nFeedback on inaccuracies:\n1. The candidate mentioned being responsible for \"general day-to-day AD administration,\" which is a good start. However, they could have elaborated on specific tasks or challenges faced in this role to provide a clearer picture of their experience.\n2. The candidate stated they were \"enforcing password policies\" and \"resetting password policies.\" It would be beneficial to clarify that enforcing password policies typically involves setting rules for password complexity and expiration, while resetting passwords is a reactive task. This distinction could enhance the understanding of their responsibilities.\n3. While the candidate mentioned using PowerShell to automate tasks, they could have provided specific examples of scripts or commands they used, which would demonstrate a deeper understanding of automation in Active Directory management. \n\nOverall, the candidate's experience is relevant and demonstrates a solid understanding of Active Directory administration, but providing more specific details would enhance the clarity and depth of their response."

        "interviewer": "I see. Can you describe your experience with networking, particularly in areas like VLAN configuration, routing, switching, and TCP/IP troubleshooting?",
        "candidate": " Sure. I've made use of primarily Cisco packet tracer when it comes to resolving a lot of the internal issues that you research that we had when it comes to networking. So I use this for simulating network environments. I also made use of Wireshark for network traffic analysis. So a lot of the issues that we would encounter would be stuff like misconfigured TCP, TCP IP setups. So I've had to troubleshoot these connectivity problems. I've had to troubleshoot slow network performance, application layer issues and a few other things. It's been quite interesting learning about all these tools and stuff. I've also made use of additional tools from a command line such as ping, traceroute, netstabbed and TCP dump to get an additional deeper level of insight into the issues, which I've quite enjoyed and definitely looking forward to learning more in this area.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a high level of concentration (0.57) and determination (0.35), along with notable levels of calmness (0.21), contentment (0.14), and satisfaction (0.25), indicating a focused and positive demeanor during the interview, which are generally desirable traits in a professional setting.",
        "feedback": "The accuracy of the answer provided is 80%.\n\nFeedback on inaccuracies:\n1. The candidate mentioned using \"Cisco packet tracer\" for simulating network environments. While this is a valid tool for learning and practice, it would be beneficial to clarify whether they have experience with real-world networking equipment or configurations, as this would provide a more comprehensive view of their practical experience.\n2. The candidate stated they encountered \"misconfigured TCP, TCP IP setups.\" It would be more precise to refer to \"misconfigured TCP/IP setups\" as a single term, which could enhance clarity.\n3. The candidate mentioned troubleshooting \"slow network performance\" and \"application layer issues,\" but did not provide specific examples or methodologies used in these troubleshooting processes. Including specific tools or techniques would demonstrate a deeper understanding of network troubleshooting.\n4. While the candidate listed several command-line tools (ping, traceroute, netstabbed, and TCP dump), \"netstabbed\" appears to be a typographical error for \"netstat.\" This could lead to confusion regarding the tools they are familiar with.\n5. The candidate expressed a desire to learn more in this area, which is positive, but it would be beneficial to mention any specific areas of networking they are particularly interested in or any plans for further education or certification.\n\nOverall, the candidate's experience is relevant, but providing more specific details and clarifications would enhance the clarity and depth of their response."

        "interviewer": "Thank you for sharing that information. Lastly, could you tell me about your experience with PowerShell, particularly in relation to tasks like backups, Azure, or EMC?",
        "candidate": " Of course, I've used Azure, mainly PowerShell. When it comes to PowerShell, I've used it to handle the deployment of Windows-based laptops that we use internally in the company. We used it for the automatic onboarding experience, such that when a user sets up their laptop, the PowerShell script that manages the actual onboarding itself would pre-install a large amount of the apps that we have our clients use. Namely, these included remote PC, so that they could access their server-based workstations in our data center. I've also made use of PowerShell for setting up and configuring Windows Server workstations using Hyper-V. Then I've also made use of Azure for Azure's Active Directory Synchronization ability, and a lot of our permissions management for our Internet-enabled network as well.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited strong positive emotions, particularly enthusiasm (0.63) and interest (0.63), along with high levels of satisfaction (0.43) and determination (0.22), suggesting they were engaged and passionate about the topic discussed, while maintaining a professional and focused demeanor as indicated by the high concentration (0.24) and contentment (0.13) scores, with minimal negative emotions or toxic elements present.",
