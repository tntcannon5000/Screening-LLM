        "interviewer": "Hello! It's nice to meet you too. Thank you for taking the time to speak with me today about the Entry-Level IT Support Engineer position. To start off, could you tell me about your experience with Microsoft Windows, particularly in troubleshooting and resolving issues?",
        "candidate": " Yeah sure, I'd be happy to. I've got about 10 years experience working with Windows. This has ranged from me using Windows 7 all the way up to Windows 11 now. In the context of my current work experience at GeoResearch, I've mostly made use of Windows 10 and 10 Server. Some of the issues that we've had to troubleshoot have ranged from Windows blue-screening to software freezing, to network issues with network adapters and a large variety of other things. I mean, it's Windows, so there is a large amount of things that can go wrong. And if it was related to Windows or any sort of technical issue, it was our and therefore my job to help resolve it for our clients.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a high level of interest (0.53) and calmness (0.41), along with moderate levels of enthusiasm (0.19) and contentment (0.11), suggesting they were engaged and composed during the interview, while also displaying a generally positive sentiment (high scores in 7-9 range) and minimal signs of toxicity, indicating a professional and appropriate demeanor.",
        "feedback": "The accuracy of the answer provided is 85%.\n\nFeedback:\n1. The candidate mentioned having \"about 10 years experience working with Windows,\" which is a strong point. However, it would be beneficial to specify the types of troubleshooting methods or tools they used, as this would provide a clearer picture of their technical skills.\n2. The candidate stated they have experience with \"Windows 10 and 10 Server.\" It should be noted that the correct terminology is \"Windows Server 2016/2019/2022\" (depending on the version), rather than \"10 Server.\" This could lead to confusion regarding their experience with server operating systems.\n3. The candidate mentioned troubleshooting a variety of issues, including blue screens and software freezing. While this is relevant, providing specific examples of how they resolved these issues or the steps they took would enhance the answer and demonstrate their problem-solving skills more effectively. \n\nOverall, the candidate's experience is relevant, but additional details on troubleshooting methods and specific examples would strengthen their response."

        "interviewer": "Thank you for sharing that information. Could you tell me about your experience with Active Directory, particularly in areas such as security groups, administration, deployment, LDAP, or ADSI?",
        "candidate": " Yeah, of course we're happy to. The majority of my experience comes with administration of Active Directory. So I've been responsible for the general day-to-day AD administration, so user and computer account management, enforcing password policies, resetting password policies and generating randomly generated passwords for user resets, and then providing it directly to them, as well as using Active Directory administrative center as well for managing the directory. I've then also been responsible for applying new role-based access control and utilizing PowerShell to automate some of these things as well.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a high level of determination (0.45) and concentration (0.38), while maintaining a calm (0.22) and satisfied (0.22) demeanor, suggesting a focused and composed approach to the interview question, with a generally positive sentiment (highest values in the 4-6 range) and minimal signs of toxicity.",
        "feedback": "The accuracy of the answer provided is 80%.\n\nFeedback:\n1. The candidate mentioned being responsible for \"general day-to-day AD administration,\" which is relevant. However, they could enhance their response by providing specific examples of tasks they performed, such as creating or modifying security groups, which is a key aspect of Active Directory management.\n2. The candidate stated they were responsible for \"enforcing password policies\" and \"resetting password policies.\" It would be beneficial to clarify the difference between enforcing and resetting password policies, as these are distinct actions within Active Directory management.\n3. The mention of using \"Active Directory administrative center\" is good, but the candidate could improve their answer by discussing any specific features or functionalities they utilized within the center, such as managing user attributes or group memberships.\n4. The candidate noted using PowerShell to automate tasks, which is a strong point. However, providing a specific example of a script or task they automated would strengthen their response and demonstrate their technical proficiency in this area.\n\nOverall, while the candidate's experience is relevant, additional details and specific examples would enhance their response and provide a clearer picture of their expertise with Active Directory."

        "interviewer": "I see. Can you describe your experience with networking, particularly in areas like VLAN configuration, routing, switching, and TCP/IP troubleshooting?",
        "candidate": " Sure. I've made use of primarily Cisco packet tracer when it comes to resolving a lot of the internal issues that you research that we had when it comes to networking. So I use this for simulating network environments. I also made use of Wireshark for network traffic analysis. So a lot of the issues that we would encounter would be stuff like misconfigured TCP, TCP IP setups. So I've had to troubleshoot these connectivity problems. I've had to troubleshoot slow network performance, application layer issues and a few other things. It's been quite interesting learning about all these tools and stuff. I've also made use of additional tools from a command line such as ping, traceroute, netstabbed and TCP dump to get an additional deeper level of insight into the issues, which I've quite enjoyed and definitely looking forward to learning more in this area.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a high level of concentration (0.572) and determination (0.355), along with notable levels of calmness (0.212), contentment (0.137), and satisfaction (0.255), indicating a focused and positive demeanor during the interview, while also displaying enthusiasm (0.187) and interest (0.173) in the topic at hand, all of which are highly desirable traits for a successful interview performance.",
        "feedback": "**Accuracy Score:** 75%\n\n**Feedback:**\n\n1. The candidate mentioned using \"Cisco packet tracer\" for simulating network environments, which is relevant. However, they could enhance their response by specifying particular scenarios or configurations they simulated, such as VLAN setups or routing protocols, to demonstrate their hands-on experience.\n\n2. The candidate stated they used \"Wireshark for network traffic analysis,\" which is a strong point. However, providing specific examples of the types of issues they analyzed with Wireshark, such as identifying packet loss or analyzing specific protocols, would strengthen their answer.\n\n3. The mention of troubleshooting \"misconfigured TCP, TCP IP setups\" is relevant, but the candidate could improve their response by detailing the specific steps they took to resolve these issues, such as checking configurations or using specific commands.\n\n4. The candidate referred to troubleshooting \"slow network performance\" and \"application layer issues.\" While these are valid points, providing concrete examples of how they diagnosed and resolved these issues would enhance their credibility and demonstrate their problem-solving skills.\n\n5. The candidate listed command-line tools like \"ping, traceroute, netstabbed, and TCP dump.\" However, \"netstabbed\" seems to be a typographical error for \"netstat.\" Clarifying the tools used and providing examples of how they applied these tools in troubleshooting would add depth to their response.\n\n6. The candidate expressed enthusiasm for learning more in the area of networking, which is positive. However, they could further demonstrate their commitment by mentioning any specific areas they are interested in exploring or any relevant courses or certifications they are pursuing."

        "interviewer": "Thank you for sharing that information. Lastly, could you tell me about your experience with PowerShell, particularly in relation to tasks like backups, Azure, or EMC?",
        "candidate": " Of course, I've used Azure, mainly PowerShell. When it comes to PowerShell, I've used it to handle the deployment of Windows-based laptops that we use internally in the company. We used it for the automatic onboarding experience, such that when a user sets up their laptop, the PowerShell script that manages the actual onboarding itself would pre-install a large amount of the apps that we have our clients use. Namely, these included remote PC, so that they could access their server-based workstations in our data center. I've also made use of PowerShell for setting up and configuring Windows Server workstations using Hyper-V. Then I've also made use of Azure for Azure's Active Directory Synchronization ability, and a lot of our permissions management for our Internet-enabled network as well.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited strong enthusiasm, interest, and satisfaction, coupled with notable levels of excitement and determination, suggesting they were highly engaged and positive about the topic being discussed, which are generally favorable traits in an interview setting.",
        "feedback": "**Accuracy Score:** 80%\n\n**Feedback:**\n\n1.
