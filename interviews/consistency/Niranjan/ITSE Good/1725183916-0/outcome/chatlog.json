        "interviewer": "Hello! It's nice to meet you too. Thank you for taking the time to speak with me today about the Entry-Level IT Support Engineer position. To start off, could you tell me about your experience with Microsoft Windows, particularly in troubleshooting and resolving issues?",
        "candidate": " Yeah sure, I'd be happy to. I've got about 10 years experience working with Windows. This has ranged from me using Windows 7 all the way up to Windows 11 now. In the context of my current work experience at GeoResearch, I've mostly made use of Windows 10 and 10 Server. Some of the issues that we've had to troubleshoot have ranged from Windows blue-screening to software freezing, to network issues with network adapters and a large variety of other things. I mean, it's Windows, so there is a large amount of things that can go wrong. And if it was related to Windows or any sort of technical issue, it was our and therefore my job to help resolve it for our clients.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a high level of interest (0.53) and calmness (0.41), along with moderate levels of enthusiasm (0.19) and contentment (0.11), suggesting they were engaged and composed during the interview, while also displaying a generally positive sentiment (high scores in 7-9 range) and minimal signs of toxicity, indicating a professional and appropriate demeanor.",
        "feedback": "The accuracy of the answer provided is 85%.\n\nFeedback:\n1. The candidate mentioned having \"about 10 years experience working with Windows,\" which is a strong point. However, it would be beneficial to specify any formal training or certifications related to Windows troubleshooting, as this could enhance credibility.\n2. The candidate stated they have experience with \"Windows 7 all the way up to Windows 11,\" which is accurate. However, they primarily mentioned working with Windows 10 and Windows Server 2010. It would be helpful to clarify the specific version of Windows Server they are referring to, as \"10 Server\" is not a standard designation (it should be Windows Server 2016 or 2019, for example).\n3. The candidate described various issues they have encountered, such as blue screens and software freezing, which aligns with common Windows troubleshooting scenarios. However, they could have elaborated on specific troubleshooting steps they took to resolve these issues, which would provide a clearer picture of their problem-solving skills.\n4. The phrase \"it's Windows, so there is a large amount of things that can go wrong\" is somewhat vague. It would be more effective to provide specific examples of troubleshooting processes or tools used, which would demonstrate a deeper understanding of the Windows operating system and its common issues.\n\nOverall, the candidate's experience is relevant, but providing more specific examples and clarifications would strengthen their response."

        "interviewer": "Thank you for sharing that information. Could you tell me about your experience with Active Directory, particularly in areas such as security groups, administration, deployment, LDAP, or ADSI?",
        "candidate": " Yeah, of course we're happy to. The majority of my experience comes with administration of Active Directory. So I've been responsible for the general day-to-day AD administration, so user and computer account management, enforcing password policies, resetting password policies and generating randomly generated passwords for user resets, and then providing it directly to them, as well as using Active Directory administrative center as well for managing the directory. I've then also been responsible for applying new role-based access control and utilizing PowerShell to automate some of these things as well.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a high level of determination (0.497) and concentration (0.362), coupled with moderate levels of satisfaction (0.183) and calmness (0.173), suggesting a focused and composed demeanor during the interview, while also displaying some signs of contemplation (0.147) and realization (0.152), which could indicate thoughtful engagement with the question at hand.",
        "feedback": "The accuracy of the answer provided is 90%.\n\nFeedback:\n1. The candidate mentioned being responsible for \"general day-to-day AD administration,\" which is a strong point. However, they could have elaborated on specific tasks or challenges faced during this administration to provide a clearer picture of their experience.\n2. The candidate stated they were involved in \"user and computer account management,\" which is relevant. It would be beneficial to include specific examples of how they managed these accounts, such as creating, modifying, or deleting accounts, or handling specific user requests.\n3. The mention of \"enforcing password policies\" and \"resetting password policies\" is somewhat unclear. It would be more effective to specify what these policies entailed and how they were enforced or reset, as this would demonstrate a deeper understanding of security practices within Active Directory.\n4. The candidate noted using the \"Active Directory administrative center\" for management, which is accurate. However, they could have provided examples of specific tasks performed using this tool to illustrate their proficiency.\n5. The mention of \"applying new role-based access control\" is relevant, but the candidate could have explained how they implemented this and the impact it had on the organization. Providing details about the AGDLP principle or specific roles created would enhance this part of the answer.\n6. The use of PowerShell for automation is a strong point, but the candidate could have included specific scripts or commands they used to automate tasks, which would demonstrate their technical skills more effectively.\n\nOverall, the candidate's experience is relevant and demonstrates a solid understanding of Active Directory administration, but providing more specific examples and clarifications would strengthen their response."

        "interviewer": "I see. Can you describe your experience with networking, particularly in areas like VLAN configuration, routing, switching, and TCP/IP troubleshooting?",
        "candidate": " Sure. I've made use of primarily Cisco packet tracer when it comes to resolving a lot of the internal issues that you research that we had when it comes to networking. So I use this for simulating network environments. I also made use of Wireshark for network traffic analysis. So a lot of the issues that we would encounter would be stuff like misconfigured TCP, TCP IP setups. So I've had to troubleshoot these connectivity problems. I've had to troubleshoot slow network performance, application layer issues and a few other things. It's been quite interesting learning about all these tools and stuff. I've also made use of additional tools from a command line such as ping, traceroute, netstabbed and TCP dump to get an additional deeper level of insight into the issues, which I've quite enjoyed and definitely looking forward to learning more in this area.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a high level of concentration (0.572) and determination (0.355), along with notable levels of calmness (0.212), contentment (0.137), and satisfaction (0.255), suggesting a focused and composed demeanor during the interview, while also displaying enthusiasm (0.187) and interest (0.173) in the topic at hand, which are all positive traits for a successful interview performance.",

The candidate mentioned using \"Cisco packet tracer\" for simulating network environments, which is a relevant tool for learning and practice. However, they could have elaborated on specific scenarios or configurations they simulated to demonstrate their practical experience with VLANs, routing, and switching.\n\n2. The candidate stated they used \"Wireshark for network traffic analysis,\" which is accurate. They mentioned troubleshooting \"misconfigured TCP, TCP IP setups,\" but it would be beneficial to provide specific examples of how they identified and resolved these misconfigurations, as this would illustrate their troubleshooting skills more effectively.\n\n3. The mention of troubleshooting \"slow network performance\" and \"application layer issues\" is relevant, but the candidate could have provided more detail on the specific steps taken to diagnose and resolve these issues, such as the types of metrics monitored or the analysis performed.\n\n4. The candidate listed command-line tools like \"ping, traceroute, netstabbed, and TCP dump.\" However, \"netstabbed\" appears to be a transcription error; it likely should be \"netstat.\" This could lead to confusion, but it does not detract from the overall understanding of their experience with command-line tools.\n\n5. The candidate expressed enthusiasm for learning more in the area of networking, which is a positive aspect. However, they could have mentioned any specific areas of networking they are particularly interested in or any plans for further education or certification, which would demonstrate a proactive approach to their professional development.\n\nOverall, while the candidate's experience is relevant and demonstrates a foundational understanding of networking concepts, providing more specific examples and clarifications would strengthen their response."

        "interviewer": "Thank you for sharing that information. Lastly, could you tell me about your experience with PowerShell, particularly in relation to tasks like backups, Azure, or EMC?",
        "candidate": " Of course, I've used Azure, mainly PowerShell. When it comes to PowerShell, I've used it to handle the deployment of Windows-based laptops that we use internally in the company. We used it for the automatic onboarding experience, such that when a user sets up their laptop, the PowerShell script that manages the actual onboarding itself would pre-install a large amount of the apps that we have our clients use. Namely, these included remote PC, so that they could access their server-based workstations in our data center. I've also made use of PowerShell for setting up and configuring Windows Server workstations using Hyper-V. Then I've also made use of Azure for Azure's Active Directory Synchronization ability, and a lot of our permissions management for our Internet-enabled network as well.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited strong positive emotions, particularly high levels of interest (0.62), enthusiasm (0.61), and satisfaction (0.40), along with a notable degree of excitement (0.30) and concentration (0.24), suggesting they were engaged, passionate, and confident about the topic being discussed, which are generally favorable traits in an interview setting.",
        "feedback": "**Accuracy Score: 85%**\n\n**Feedback:**\n\n1. The candidate mentioned using PowerShell primarily for handling the deployment of Windows-based laptops and automating the onboarding experience. This is relevant experience, but it would be beneficial to specify any particular PowerShell modules or commands they used for these tasks, as this would demonstrate a deeper understanding of PowerShell's capabilities.\n\n2.
