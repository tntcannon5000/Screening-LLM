        "interviewer": "Thank you for sharing that information. Could you tell me about your experience with Active Directory, particularly in areas such as security groups, administration, deployment, LDAP, or ADSI?",
        "candidate": " Yeah, of course we're happy to. The majority of my experience comes with administration of Active Directory. So I've been responsible for the general day-to-day AD administration, so user and computer account management, enforcing password policies, resetting password policies and generating randomly generated passwords for user resets, and then providing it directly to them, as well as using Active Directory administrative center as well for managing the directory. I've then also been responsible for applying new role-based access control and utilizing PowerShell to automate some of these things as well.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited strong determination and concentration, coupled with a moderate level of calmness and satisfaction, suggesting a focused and composed demeanor during the interview, while also displaying signs of contemplation and realization, which could indicate thoughtful and insightful responses to the interviewer's questions.",
        "feedback": "The accuracy of the answer provided is 80%.\n\nFeedback:\n1. The candidate mentioned being responsible for \"general day-to-day AD administration,\" which is a good start. However, they could have elaborated on specific tasks related to security groups, such as creating, modifying, or managing group memberships, which is a critical aspect of Active Directory management.\n\n2. The candidate discussed \"enforcing password policies\" and \"resetting password policies,\" but it would be beneficial to clarify the difference between enforcing and resetting. Enforcing password policies typically involves setting rules for password complexity and expiration, while resetting involves changing a user's password. Providing specific examples of how they enforced these policies would enhance their response.\n\n3. The mention of using the \"Active Directory administrative center\" is relevant, but the candidate could have included more details about specific tasks they performed within that tool, such as managing user accounts, groups, or organizational units.\n\n4. The candidate stated they were responsible for \"applying new role-based access control,\" but did not provide any examples of how they implemented this or the impact it had on security. Discussing specific scenarios or challenges faced while applying role-based access control would demonstrate a deeper understanding of the concept.\n\n5. The use of PowerShell for automation is a strong point, but the candidate could have provided specific examples of scripts or tasks they automated. This would illustrate their technical proficiency and ability to streamline processes within Active Directory.\n\nOverall, while the candidate's experience is evident, providing more specific examples and details related to security groups, password policies, and the use of PowerShell would strengthen their response."

        "interviewer": "I see. Can you describe your experience with networking, particularly in areas like VLAN configuration, routing, switching, and TCP/IP troubleshooting?",
        "candidate": " Sure. I've made use of primarily Cisco packet tracer when it comes to resolving a lot of the internal issues that you research that we had when it comes to networking. So I use this for simulating network environments. I also made use of Wireshark for network traffic analysis. So a lot of the issues that we would encounter would be stuff like misconfigured TCP, TCP IP setups. So I've had to troubleshoot these connectivity problems. I've had to troubleshoot slow network performance, application layer issues and a few other things. It's been quite interesting learning about all these tools and stuff. I've also made use of additional tools from a command line such as ping, traceroute, netstabbed and TCP dump to get an additional deeper level of insight into the issues, which I've quite enjoyed and definitely looking forward to learning more in this area.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a high level of concentration (0.572) and determination (0.355), coupled with a sense of calmness (0.212) and contentment (0.137), suggesting a focused and composed demeanor during the interview, while also displaying enthusiasm (0.187) and interest (0.173) in the topic at hand, which are generally positive traits for a successful interview performance.",
        "feedback": "The accuracy of the answer provided is 75%.\n\nFeedback:\n1. The candidate mentioned using \"Cisco packet tracer\" for simulating network environments, which is relevant. However, they could have elaborated on specific scenarios or configurations they simulated, such as setting up VLANs or routing protocols, to demonstrate their hands-on experience.\n\n2. The use of \"Wireshark for network traffic analysis\" is a strong point, but the candidate did not provide specific examples of the types of analyses they performed or issues they identified using Wireshark. Mentioning specific cases where they analyzed traffic patterns or identified anomalies would enhance their response.\n\n3. The candidate referred to troubleshooting \"misconfigured TCP, TCP IP setups,\" but did not provide details on the specific steps they took to resolve these issues.

        "candidate": " Of course, I've used Azure, mainly PowerShell. When it comes to PowerShell, I've used it to handle the deployment of Windows-based laptops that we use internally in the company. We used it for the automatic onboarding experience, such that when a user sets up their laptop, the PowerShell script that manages the actual onboarding itself would pre-install a large amount of the apps that we have our clients use. Namely, these included remote PC, so that they could access their server-based workstations in our data center. I've also made use of PowerShell for setting up and configuring Windows Server workstations using Hyper-V. Then I've also made use of Azure for Azure's Active Directory Synchronization ability, and a lot of our permissions management for our Internet-enabled network as well.",
