        "interviewer": "Hello! It's nice to meet you too. Thank you for taking the time to speak with me today about the Entry-Level IT Support Engineer position. To start off, could you tell me about your experience with Microsoft Windows, particularly in troubleshooting and resolving issues?",
        "candidate": " Yeah sure, I'd be happy to. I've got about 10 years experience working with Windows. This has ranged from me using Windows 7 all the way up to Windows 11 now. In the context of my current work experience at GeoResearch, I've mostly made use of Windows 10 and 10 Server. Some of the issues that we've had to troubleshoot have ranged from Windows blue-screening to software freezing, to network issues with network adapters and a large variety of other things. I mean, it's Windows, so there is a large amount of things that can go wrong. And if it was related to Windows or any sort of technical issue, it was our and therefore my job to help resolve it for our clients.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a high level of interest (0.53) and calmness (0.41), coupled with moderate levels of enthusiasm (0.19) and contentment (0.11), suggesting they were engaged and composed during the interview, while also displaying a positive sentiment (high scores in 7-9 range) and minimal signs of toxicity, indicating a professional and appropriate demeanor.",
        "feedback": "The accuracy of the answer provided is 85%.\n\nFeedback:\n1. The candidate mentioned having \"about 10 years experience working with Windows,\" which is a strong point. However, it would be beneficial to specify the types of troubleshooting methods or tools they used, as this would provide a clearer picture of their technical skills.\n2. The candidate stated they have experience with \"Windows 10 and 10 Server.\" It should be noted that the correct terminology is \"Windows Server 2016/2019/2022\" (depending on the version) rather than \"10 Server.\" This could be a transcription error, but it is important to clarify the specific server version for accuracy.\n3. The candidate described various issues they have encountered, such as blue screens and software freezing, which is relevant and demonstrates their experience. However, they could enhance their answer by briefly mentioning how they resolved these issues or any specific troubleshooting steps they took, which would showcase their problem-solving skills more effectively."

        "interviewer": "Thank you for sharing that information. Could you tell me about your experience with Active Directory, particularly in areas such as security groups, administration, deployment, LDAP, or ADSI?",
        "candidate": " Yeah, of course we're happy to. The majority of my experience comes with administration of Active Directory. So I've been responsible for the general day-to-day AD administration, so user and computer account management, enforcing password policies, resetting password policies and generating randomly generated passwords for user resets, and then providing it directly to them, as well as using Active Directory administrative center as well for managing the directory. I've then also been responsible for applying new role-based access control and utilizing PowerShell to automate some of these things as well.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a high level of determination and concentration, coupled with moderate levels of satisfaction and calmness, suggesting a focused and composed demeanor during the interview, while also displaying some anxiety and contemplation, which could indicate thoughtful consideration of the question at hand.",
        "feedback": "The accuracy of the answer provided is 90%.\n\nFeedback:\n1. The candidate mentioned their experience with \"general day-to-day AD administration,\" which is relevant and indicates a solid understanding of Active Directory operations. However, they could enhance their response by specifying the types of security groups they have managed or created, as this would provide a clearer picture of their experience in that area.\n2. The candidate discussed enforcing password policies and resetting passwords, which is pertinent to Active Directory security. It would be beneficial to elaborate on how they enforce these policies or any specific challenges they faced in this area.\n3. The mention of using PowerShell to automate tasks is a strong point, as automation is a key skill in managing Active Directory efficiently. Providing a specific example of a task they automated would further strengthen their answer.\n4. The candidate did not mention their experience with LDAP or ADSI, which are important components of Active Directory management. While these were not explicitly asked in the question, a brief mention of familiarity with these technologies could have showcased a more comprehensive understanding of Active Directory."

        "interviewer": "I see. Can you describe your experience with networking, particularly in areas like VLAN configuration, routing, switching, and TCP/IP troubleshooting?",
        "candidate": " Sure. I've made use of primarily Cisco packet tracer when it comes to resolving a lot of the internal issues that you research that we had when it comes to networking. So I use this for simulating network environments. I also made use of Wireshark for network traffic analysis. So a lot of the issues that we would encounter would be stuff like misconfigured TCP, TCP IP setups. So I've had to troubleshoot these connectivity problems. I've had to troubleshoot slow network performance, application layer issues and a few other things. It's been quite interesting learning about all these tools and stuff. I've also made use of additional tools from a command line such as ping, traceroute, netstabbed and TCP dump to get an additional deeper level of insight into the issues, which I've quite enjoyed and definitely looking forward to learning more in this area.",
        "sentiment": null,
        "feedback": "The accuracy of the answer provided is 80%.\n\nFeedback:\n1. The candidate mentioned using Cisco Packet Tracer for simulating network environments, which is relevant and indicates practical experience. However, they could enhance their response by specifying particular scenarios or configurations they worked on, such as specific VLAN setups or routing protocols, to provide a clearer picture of their hands-on experience.\n2. The candidate stated they used Wireshark for network traffic analysis, which is a strong point. They mentioned troubleshooting misconfigured TCP/IP setups, but it would be beneficial to elaborate on specific troubleshooting steps they took or examples of issues they resolved using Wireshark.\n3. The mention of using command-line tools like ping, traceroute, and tcpdump is good, but the candidate incorrectly referred to \"netstabbed,\" which seems to be a transcription error for \"netstat.\" This could lead to confusion about their familiarity with network troubleshooting tools.\n4. The candidate expressed enthusiasm for learning more in the area of networking, which is positive. However, they could strengthen their answer by mentioning any specific areas they are particularly interested in or any plans for further education or certification in networking."

        "interviewer": "Thank you for sharing that information. Lastly, could you tell me about your experience with PowerShell, particularly in relation to tasks like backups, Azure, or EMC?",
        "candidate": " Of course, I've used Azure, mainly PowerShell. When it comes to PowerShell, I've used it to handle the deployment of Windows-based laptops that we use internally in the company. We used it for the automatic onboarding experience, such that when a user sets up their laptop, the PowerShell script that manages the actual onboarding itself would pre-install a large amount of the apps that we have our clients use. Namely, these included remote PC, so that they could access their server-based workstations in our data center. I've also made use of PowerShell for setting up and configuring Windows Server workstations using Hyper-V. Then I've also made use of Azure for Azure's Active Directory Synchronization ability, and a lot of our permissions management for our Internet-enabled network as well.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited high levels of interest (0.62), enthusiasm (0.61), and satisfaction (0.40), coupled with strong concentration (0.24) and determination (0.21), suggesting they were engaged, positive, and focused during this part of the interview, which are generally desirable traits for a successful candidate.",
