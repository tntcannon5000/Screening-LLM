The candidate demonstrated extensive experience with Windows, spanning from Windows 7 to Windows 11. They mentioned 10 years of experience, which is impressive for an entry-level position.

2. Active Directory:
The candidate showed good knowledge of Active Directory administration, including user and computer account management, password policies, and role-based access control.

3. Networking:
The candidate demonstrated familiarity with networking tools like Cisco Packet Tracer, Wireshark, and command-line utilities. They mentioned experience in troubleshooting TCP/IP issues, slow network performance, and application layer problems. However, they didn't specifically address VLAN configuration or routing and switching experience as requested in the question.

4. PowerShell and Azure:
