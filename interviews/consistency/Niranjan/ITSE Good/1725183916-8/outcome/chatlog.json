        "interviewer": "Hello! It's nice to meet you too. Thank you for taking the time to speak with me today about the Entry-Level IT Support Engineer position. To start off, could you tell me about your experience with Microsoft Windows, particularly in troubleshooting and resolving issues?",
        "candidate": " Yeah sure, I'd be happy to. I've got about 10 years experience working with Windows. This has ranged from me using Windows 7 all the way up to Windows 11 now. In the context of my current work experience at GeoResearch, I've mostly made use of Windows 10 and 10 Server. Some of the issues that we've had to troubleshoot have ranged from Windows blue-screening to software freezing, to network issues with network adapters and a large variety of other things. I mean, it's Windows, so there is a large amount of things that can go wrong. And if it was related to Windows or any sort of technical issue, it was our and therefore my job to help resolve it for our clients.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a high level of interest (0.53) and calmness (0.41), coupled with moderate enthusiasm (0.19) and contentment (0.11), suggesting they were engaged and composed during the interview while maintaining a positive and enthusiastic demeanor.",
        "feedback": "The accuracy of the answer provided is 85%.\n\nFeedback:\n1. The candidate mentioned having \"about 10 years experience working with Windows,\" which is a strong point. However, it would be beneficial to specify the types of troubleshooting methods or tools they used, as this would provide a clearer picture of their technical skills.\n2. The candidate stated they have experience with \"Windows 10 and 10 Server.\" It should be noted that the correct terminology is \"Windows Server 2016/2019/2022\" (depending on the version) rather than \"10 Server.\" This could be seen as a minor inaccuracy in terminology.\n3. The candidate described various issues they have encountered, such as blue screens and software freezing, which is relevant and demonstrates their experience. However, they could enhance their response by briefly explaining how they resolved these issues or the steps they took during troubleshooting.\n4. The phrase \"it's Windows, so there is a large amount of things that can go wrong\" is somewhat vague. Providing specific examples of common issues and how they were addressed would strengthen the answer.\n\nOverall, the candidate's experience is evident, but adding more detail about their troubleshooting processes and specific examples would improve the response."

        "interviewer": "Thank you for sharing that information. Could you tell me about your experience with Active Directory, particularly in areas such as security groups, administration, deployment, LDAP, or ADSI?",
        "candidate": " Yeah, of course we're happy to. The majority of my experience comes with administration of Active Directory. So I've been responsible for the general day-to-day AD administration, so user and computer account management, enforcing password policies, resetting password policies and generating randomly generated passwords for user resets, and then providing it directly to them, as well as using Active Directory administrative center as well for managing the directory. I've then also been responsible for applying new role-based access control and utilizing PowerShell to automate some of these things as well.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a high level of determination and concentration, balanced with calmness and contemplation, suggesting a focused and thoughtful approach to the interview question, while also displaying moderate levels of satisfaction and pride, indicating confidence in their response without appearing overly boastful.",
        "feedback": "The accuracy of the answer provided is 80%.\n\nFeedback:\n1. The candidate mentioned being responsible for \"general day-to-day AD administration,\" which is relevant and indicates a solid foundation in Active Directory management. However, they could enhance their response by specifying the types of security groups they have managed and how they enforced security policies, as this is a critical aspect of Active Directory.\n\n2. The candidate discussed \"enforcing password policies\" and \"resetting password policies,\" but it would be beneficial to clarify the specific password policies they enforced (e.g., complexity requirements, expiration policies) to demonstrate a deeper understanding of security practices within Active Directory.\n\n3. The mention of using \"Active Directory administrative center\" is good, but the candidate could improve their answer by briefly explaining how they utilized it in their daily tasks or any specific features they found particularly useful.\n\n4. The candidate stated they were responsible for \"applying new role-based access control,\" which is relevant. However, they could provide more detail on how they implemented this and the impact it had on security and user access.\n\n5. The use of PowerShell for automation is a strong point, but the candidate could enhance their response by providing a specific example of a task they automated with PowerShell, which would illustrate their technical skills and experience more effectively. \n\nOverall, while the candidate's experience is evident, adding more detail about their specific responsibilities and examples of their work would strengthen the response."

        "interviewer": "I see. Can you describe your experience with networking, particularly in areas like VLAN configuration, routing, switching, and TCP/IP troubleshooting?",
        "candidate": " Sure. I've made use of primarily Cisco packet tracer when it comes to resolving a lot of the internal issues that you research that we had when it comes to networking. So I use this for simulating network environments. I also made use of Wireshark for network traffic analysis. So a lot of the issues that we would encounter would be stuff like misconfigured TCP, TCP IP setups. So I've had to troubleshoot these connectivity problems. I've had to troubleshoot slow network performance, application layer issues and a few other things. It's been quite interesting learning about all these tools and stuff. I've also made use of additional tools from a command line such as ping, traceroute, netstabbed and TCP dump to get an additional deeper level of insight into the issues, which I've quite enjoyed and definitely looking forward to learning more in this area.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a high level of concentration (0.572) and determination (0.355), coupled with a sense of calmness (0.212) and contentment (0.137), suggesting a focused and composed demeanor during the interview, while also displaying enthusiasm (0.187) and satisfaction (0.255) which could be interpreted as positive engagement with the topic or question at hand.",
        "feedback": "The accuracy of the answer provided is 75%.\n\nFeedback:\n1. The candidate mentioned using Cisco Packet Tracer for simulating network environments, which is relevant. However, they could enhance their response by specifying particular scenarios or configurations they simulated, such as specific VLAN setups or routing protocols, to demonstrate a deeper understanding of these concepts.\n\n2. The candidate stated they used Wireshark for network traffic analysis, which is a strong point.

        "interviewer": "Thank you for sharing that information. Lastly, could you tell me about your experience with PowerShell, particularly in relation to tasks like backups, Azure, or EMC?",
        "candidate": " Of course, I've used Azure, mainly PowerShell. When it comes to PowerShell, I've used it to handle the deployment of Windows-based laptops that we use internally in the company. We used it for the automatic onboarding experience, such that when a user sets up their laptop, the PowerShell script that manages the actual onboarding itself would pre-install a large amount of the apps that we have our clients use. Namely, these included remote PC, so that they could access their server-based workstations in our data center. I've also made use of PowerShell for setting up and configuring Windows Server workstations using Hyper-V. Then I've also made use of Azure for Azure's Active Directory Synchronization ability, and a lot of our permissions management for our Internet-enabled network as well.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited strong enthusiasm and interest, coupled with high levels of satisfaction and excitement, suggesting they were highly engaged and positive about the topic discussed, while also displaying notable concentration and determination, which are desirable traits in a successful interview setting.",
