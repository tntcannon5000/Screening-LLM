        "interviewer": "Hello! It's nice to meet you too. Thank you for taking the time to speak with me today about the Entry-Level IT Support Engineer position. To start off, could you tell me about your experience with Microsoft Windows, particularly in troubleshooting and resolving issues?",
        "candidate": " Sure, I've got five years of experience with Windows and throughout this time I've had to troubleshoot various issues involving blue screens, software crashing and several other common issues when it comes to Windows.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a predominantly calm and neutral demeanor, with notable levels of interest, realization, and contemplation, suggesting they were engaged and thoughtful in their response, while maintaining a professional and composed attitude suitable for an interview setting.",
        "feedback": "The accuracy of the answer provided is 80%.\n\nFeedback:\n1. The candidate mentioned having five years of experience with Windows and troubleshooting various issues, which is a good start. However, they could have elaborated on specific troubleshooting methods or tools they used for resolving blue screens and software crashes. Providing more detail about their approach would strengthen their response.\n2. The answer lacks mention of common troubleshooting steps for blue screens, such as checking for hardware changes, using safe mode, or utilizing the Blue Screen Troubleshooter in the Get Help app. Including these details would demonstrate a deeper understanding of the troubleshooting process.\n3. While the candidate's experience is relevant, they could improve their answer by discussing how they resolved specific issues or any particular challenges they faced during troubleshooting. This would provide a clearer picture of their problem-solving skills.\n\nOverall, the candidate's experience is relevant, but more detail and specific examples would enhance the quality of their response."

        "interviewer": "That's good to hear. Can you describe your experience with Active Directory, particularly in areas like security groups and administration?",
        "candidate": " Sure, I've had to configure Active Directory Security Groups before for our entire company. And then when it comes to administering Active Directory, anytime we had issues that required changes in ADs such as a password reset or changing of groups, I would be solving those JIRA tickets and getting it sorted for our customers.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a high level of concentration (0.67) and determination (0.46), while also showing signs of contemplation (0.23) and annoyance (0.23), suggesting they were focused and engaged but potentially struggling with some aspect of the question or their response.",
        "feedback": "The accuracy of the answer provided is 75%.\n\nFeedback:\n1. The candidate mentions configuring Active Directory Security Groups for the entire company, which indicates relevant experience. However, they could have elaborated on the specific types of security groups they configured (e.g., distribution groups, security groups) and the purpose of these groups in relation to access control and permissions.\n2. The candidate states that they resolved JIRA tickets related to Active Directory issues, which is a good point. However, they could improve their answer by providing specific examples of the types of issues they encountered (e.g., user access issues, group membership changes) and how they resolved them. This would demonstrate a deeper understanding of Active Directory administration.\n3. The answer lacks detail on the security aspects of Active Directory, such as how security groups help maintain a policy of least privilege or how they are modified via the AD portal. Including this information would show a more comprehensive understanding of the role of security groups in Active Directory.\n4. The candidate could also mention any tools or methods they used for managing Active Directory, such as PowerShell commands or the Active Directory Users and Computers (ADUC) console, which would further demonstrate their technical proficiency."

        "interviewer": "Thank you for sharing that. Moving on, what experience do you have with Windows Server environments, specifically versions 2012 and 2016?",
        "candidate": " Sure. I have experience with Windows Server environments. We host several Windows servers, primarily with Windows 2012 and 2016. So I've been in charge of rebooting services that may have stopped on these servers or identifying why certain services keep on crashing. If the system itself is blue-screening or crashing, that was also my job to investigate and resolve problems.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a high level of concentration (0.63) and determination (0.45), while maintaining a calm demeanor (0.31), suggesting a focused and composed approach to the interview question, although there were slight undertones of annoyance (0.11) and contemplation (0.13) which could indicate some challenges in formulating their response.",
        "feedback": "The accuracy of the answer provided is 70%.\n\nFeedback:\n1. The candidate mentions being in charge of rebooting services and investigating crashes, which indicates relevant experience. However, they could have elaborated on specific troubleshooting methods they used when services stopped or when investigating blue screens. For example, discussing the use of event logs or specific diagnostic tools would demonstrate a deeper understanding of the troubleshooting process.\n\n2. The answer lacks detail on the common causes of blue screens and how the candidate approached resolving them. Including information about checking for third-party driver issues, hardware problems, or using safe mode would show a more comprehensive understanding of the troubleshooting process for blue screens.\n\n3. While the candidate's experience with rebooting services and investigating crashes is relevant, they could improve their answer by providing specific examples of issues they encountered and how they resolved them. This would provide a clearer picture of their problem-solving skills and technical proficiency in a Windows Server environment.\n\n4. The candidate could also mention any tools or methods they used for monitoring server performance or diagnosing issues, such as Performance Monitor or Windows Event Viewer, which would further demonstrate their technical capabilities in managing Windows Server environments."

        "interviewer": "I see. Can you tell me about your experience with networking, particularly in areas like VLAN configuration, routing, and TCP/IP troubleshooting?",
        "candidate": " Sure, when setting up the network for our company, it was my job to set up the VLAN and then if there's any issues involving TCP or IP troubleshooting, it was my job to sort of deal with those. I made use of certain tools like Wireshark for this.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a high level of annoyance (0.70) and considerable disapproval (0.23), along with moderate levels of anger (0.14), contempt (0.13), and disappointment (0.13), suggesting a notably negative emotional state that could be concerning in an interview context, despite showing some concentration (0.19) and determination (0.12).",
        "feedback": "The accuracy of the answer provided is 65%.\n\nFeedback:\n1. The candidate mentions setting up VLANs and dealing with TCP/IP troubleshooting, which indicates relevant experience. However, they do not provide specific details about the VLAN configuration process, such as the types of VLANs they set up (e.g., static or dynamic VLANs) or the specific configurations they implemented. Including this information would demonstrate a deeper understanding of VLAN management.\n\n2. The answer lacks detail on the tools and methods used for VLAN configuration beyond just mentioning troubleshooting. For example, discussing the use of network management tools or specific commands for configuring VLANs would enhance their response.\n\n3. While the candidate mentions using Wireshark for TCP/IP troubleshooting, they do not elaborate on how they used it or what specific issues they addressed. Providing examples of the types of TCP/IP issues they encountered and how they resolved them would strengthen their answer.\n\n4. The candidate could also mention any other troubleshooting tools or techniques they used for TCP/IP issues, such as ping, traceroute, or checking network configurations, which would further demonstrate their technical proficiency in networking.\n\nOverall, while the candidate has relevant experience, more detail and specific examples would enhance the quality of their response."
