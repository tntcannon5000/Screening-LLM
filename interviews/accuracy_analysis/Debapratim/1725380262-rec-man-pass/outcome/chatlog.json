        "interviewer": "Hello! Thank you for taking the time to speak with me today about the Entry Level RAG Engineer position. I'd like to ask you a few questions to learn more about your experience and skills. Could you tell me about your experience with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines?",
        "candidate": " Yes, sure. I have some experience in retrieval of augmented generation pipelines. Mainly I used RAG to do my final thesis project, which is an automated screening system. I used RAG for the verification process to put up-to-date information from the internet in the context of an LLM so that it can verify all the information that is available currently.",

    {
        "interviewer": "That's interesting. Can you elaborate on the specific challenges you faced while implementing RAG in your thesis project, and how you overcame them?",
        "candidate": " Sure, so breaking down a candidate's answer into queries wasn't my first approach. I couldn't find a way to break down the answer or like provide a search query for getting information on the relevant topics and then through query decomposition I got relevant answers like by breaking down the string into sub queries and then searching for it. That expanded the search space so that is how I solved it.",
