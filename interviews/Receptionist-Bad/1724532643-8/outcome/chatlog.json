        "interviewer": "Hello! Thank you for taking the time to speak with me today about the Entry-Level Morning Receptionist position at our research institute. I'd like to ask you a few questions to learn more about your qualifications and interest in the role. Could you start by telling me what attracted you to this position?",
        "candidate": " Yes, so I needed to make some quick money and I also have some experience as a receptionist working at the University of Kent. I guess the combination of those two.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a notable level of calmness (0.32) and interest (0.22), alongside moderate levels of positive surprise (0.16), boredom (0.11), and enthusiasm (0.09), suggesting an engaged yet somewhat reserved demeanor that could be interpreted as professional composure during the interview.",
        "feedback": "The accuracy of the answer provided is 60%.\n\nFeedback:\n1. The candidate mentioned needing to make \"some quick money,\" which may come across as lacking genuine interest in the role. It's important to express enthusiasm for the position and the organization rather than focusing solely on financial motivation.\n2. While the candidate did mention relevant experience as a receptionist at the University of Kent, they did not elaborate on how that experience specifically relates to the responsibilities of the Entry-Level Morning Receptionist position at the research institute. Providing more detail about relevant skills or experiences would strengthen the response. \n\nOverall, the candidate should aim to convey a stronger interest in the role and connect their past experience more directly to the position they are applying for."

        "interviewer": "I see. Thank you for sharing that. Could you tell me more about your experience as a receptionist at the University of Kent? What were some of your main responsibilities in that role?",
        "candidate": " I guess some of the main responsibilities was listening to clients complain and sorting out their complaints Making keychains not keychains fobs for guests To lead them to the specific room to help For them to have access to the specific kitchen and always and you know, hmm nothing else",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a high level of contemplation and interest, with moderate levels of realization and confusion, suggesting they were deeply engaged in thoughtful consideration of the question while potentially grappling with some complex aspects of their answer.",
        "feedback": "The accuracy of the answer provided is 50%.\n\nFeedback:\n1. The candidate's response lacks clarity and coherence. Phrases like \"Making keychains not keychains fobs for guests\" are confusing and do not clearly convey the responsibilities associated with the role. This could lead to misunderstandings about their actual duties.\n2. The mention of \"listening to clients complain and sorting out their complaints\" is relevant but could be elaborated upon. It would be beneficial for the candidate to describe how they handled complaints effectively or any specific skills they utilized in that context.\n3. The phrase \"to lead them to the specific room to help\" is vague. The candidate should specify what kind of assistance they provided and how it contributed to the overall experience of the guests.\n4. The closing statement, \"and always and you know, hmm nothing else,\" indicates a lack of confidence or completeness in their response. The candidate should aim to provide a more comprehensive overview of their responsibilities to demonstrate their experience effectively."

        "interviewer": "Thank you for sharing those details. Can you describe a situation where you had to handle a difficult customer or resolve a complex issue while working at the reception desk?",
        "candidate": " Yeah, a customer came complaining that there was someone else in their room because it was double booked and they were screaming and so I didn't do the booking and yeah, I had to face the consequences, but you know I made them understand that it wasn't my fault and they should raise the complaint somewhere else.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a high level of annoyance (0.799) and contempt (0.366), along with significant disapproval (0.411) and anger (0.225), suggesting a strongly negative emotional state that could be detrimental in an interview setting, especially given the low positive emotion scores and the predominantly negative sentiment ratings.",
        "feedback": "**Accuracy Score: 40%**\n\n**Feedback:**\n\n1. **Lack of Professionalism:** The candidate's response comes across as unprofessional. Phrases like \"I didn't do the booking\" and \"they should raise the complaint somewhere else\" suggest a lack of accountability and empathy. In a customer service role, it's important to take ownership of the situation and offer solutions rather than deflecting responsibility.\n\n2. **Insufficient Detail on Resolution:** The candidate did not provide any specific details about how they handled the situation beyond stating that they made the customer understand it wasn't their fault. A more effective response would include steps taken to resolve the issue, such as offering an alternative room, apologizing for the inconvenience, or involving a manager.\n\n3. **Emotional Tone:** The use of informal language and phrases like \"you know\" and \"yeah\" detracts from the professionalism expected in a receptionist role. The candidate should aim to maintain a more formal tone when discussing their experiences, especially in a customer service context.\n\n4. **Failure to Demonstrate Problem-Solving Skills:** The answer lacks an explanation of how the candidate approached the problem or what skills they utilized to de-escalate the situation. Highlighting problem-solving abilities and conflict resolution skills would strengthen the response significantly."

        "interviewer": "I see. Thank you for sharing that experience. Our receptionist role requires excellent communication skills and the ability to multitask. Can you give an example of how you've managed multiple tasks or priorities simultaneously in a professional setting?",
        "candidate": " Yes, so during my work at reception I do generally get a lot of free time when there are no guests that are coming in. So in this instance I do work on a lot of personal stuff such as writing my dissertation. So in one such instance if a guest comes in I have to prioritize booking the room or creating a for-for the guest and not do my work. So that would be one instance when I multitask or prioritize something more valuable.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited strong feelings of annoyance (0.586) and anger (0.507), coupled with significant levels of distress (0.392), anxiety (0.155), and confusion (0.153), suggesting they were struggling with negative emotions and potentially feeling overwhelmed or frustrated during this part of the interview.",
        "feedback": "**Accuracy Score: 45%**\n\n**Feedback:**\n\n1. **Lack of Relevant Examples:** The candidate mentions having \"a lot of free time\" and working on personal tasks like writing a dissertation. This does not effectively demonstrate multitasking in a professional setting. Instead, the candidate should provide a specific example of a time when they had to manage multiple tasks simultaneously while attending to guests or handling reception duties.\n\n2. **Prioritization Explanation:** The candidate states they prioritize booking a room or creating something for the guest but does not elaborate on how they manage these tasks when they overlap. A clearer explanation of the decision-making process and how they balance competing priorities would strengthen the response.\n\n3. **Clarity and Coherence:** The response lacks clarity, particularly in the phrase \"creating a for-for the guest,\" which seems to be a transcription error. However, the candidate should aim to articulate their thoughts more clearly to avoid confusion.\n\n4. **Professionalism:** The overall tone of the response could be more professional. Phrases like \"I do generally get a lot of free time\" may come across as casual and not suitable for a job interview context. The candidate should strive for a more formal tone when discussing their experiences and responsibilities."
