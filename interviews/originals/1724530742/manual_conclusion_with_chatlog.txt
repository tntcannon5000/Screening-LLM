              '1. **Current Position Duration**: The candidate states they '
              'have been working as a part-time receptionist for "a year right '
              'now." If this is not accurate based on the current date, it '

              'position is specifically at a research institute in a different '
              'location, this could be seen as a mismatch in interest. It '

              '3. **Relevance of Previous Experience**: While the candidate '

              '1. **Availability Commitment**: The candidate does not directly '
              'address the specific hours required for the position (8:30 AM '
              'to 12:45 PM, Monday to Friday). While they mention being able '

              'their ability to commit to the specific part-time hours '

              'of the question that should have been explicitly addressed.\n'
              '\n'
              '2. **Current Working Hours**: The candidate states their '
              'current working hours as "from 9 a.m. to 2 a.m. 2 p.m." which '
              'appears to be a transcription error. The intended meaning seems '

              'hours more clearly.\n'
              '\n'
              '3. **Punctuality Statement**: While the candidate mentions '
              'being punctual, it would strengthen their response to provide a '
              'specific example or context that demonstrates their punctuality '
              'in previous roles. This would help to substantiate their '
              'claim.\n'

 {'candidate': " I'm sure. I think the most important customer service or "
               'speaking skills come into focus when the customer is agitated. '
               'So one such example would be double booking the same room for '
               'two different customers. This happened one time when I was at '
               'reception even though I was not responsible for that '
               'particular booking. So the customer was very angry at the '
               'situation and when they approached reception they wanted to '
               'get answers. However, I had to take the responsibility on '
               'myself and had to have a very apologetic tone when dealing '
               'with the customer and to kind of show them that this was an '
               'error with the booking system itself not with the reception. '
               'And eventually they understood and we were able to book a new '
               'room for them. And one such situation from my time as a '
               'support engineer would be when I initially joined the role I '
               'did not know the layouts of the entire application or the '
               'pitfalls of the application I was working on and I had a '
               'really high or tense call with a customer since their '
               'transactions were not processed at a specific date. I had to '
               'get help from my senior support staff and also convince them '
               'of the technical difficulties why they could not do and there '
               'was nothing that could be done at the moment and if they '
               'allowed us two days of time we would enable the transaction '
               'and that this would not happen in the future. And the customer '
               'was convinced and they continued to use our software from '
               'there on. So these are the two circumstances that come into '
               'mind when dealing with customers in a very efficient and '
               'responsible and apologetic way to cool them down.',

              '\n'
              '1. **Responsibility in Handling Customer Issues**: The '
              'candidate mentions taking responsibility for a double booking '
              'error, even though it was not their fault. While this '
              'demonstrates accountability, it could be more effective to '
              'clarify that they empathized with the customer while also '
              'explaining the situation. This aligns with best practices for '
              'dealing with angry customers, which emphasize understanding and '
              'sympathy (as noted in the provided context).\n'
              '\n'
              '2. **Tone and Communication**: The candidate describes using an '
              '"apologetic tone" when dealing with the angry customer. While '
              'this is a good approach, it would strengthen their response to '
              'include specific phrases or techniques they used to calm the '
              'customer down, as suggested in the context. For example, using '
              'phrases like "I completely understand the frustration you’re '
              'feeling" could illustrate their communication skills more '
              'effectively.\n'
              '\n'
              '3. **Connection to Technical Support Experience**: The '
              'candidate shares an experience from their time as a support '

              'used in that role translate to the receptionist position. '
              'Highlighting skills such as problem-solving and clear '

              '4. **Clarity and Structure**: The response could benefit from '
              'clearer structure. The candidate jumps between two examples '
              'without a clear transition, which may make it harder for the '
              'interviewer to follow. Organizing the response into distinct '

              'describes their technical skills and experience, they could '
              'strengthen their response by explicitly connecting how these '
              'skills translate to the receptionist position. For example, '

 'suggest they could be a good fit for the role. Given the directive to pass '
 'only 47% of candidates, and considering the strengths demonstrated in this '
