               "I'm working on making a automated screening Interview agent "
               'and to implement this I have used a rag pipeline mainly as the '
               'accuracy verifier so what happens is when the Candidate '
               'answers their questions it goes through two pipelines one is '
               'the sentiment analysis and one is the accuracy verifier For '
               'the accuracy verifier I have implemented a retrieval augmented '
               'generation, which would basically break down the answer into '
               'separate Searchable strings which will then be searched on '
               'Google and The first two articles it will retrieve the '
               'contents of the first two articles and input that in the '
               'context of the LLM So the LM has more up-to-date information '
               'to verify with the whether the answer from the candidate is '

              '1. The candidate mentions using a RAG pipeline for an automated '
              'screening interview agent, which is relevant and demonstrates '
              'practical experience. However, the explanation of how the RAG '
              'pipeline is implemented could be clearer. The candidate states '
              'that the answer is broken down into "searchable strings" and '
              'then searched on Google. While this indicates an understanding '
              'of retrieval, it would be beneficial to clarify how the '
              "retrieved information is integrated into the LLM's context for "
              'generating a response.\n'
              '\n'
              '2. The candidate describes using sentiment analysis alongside '
              'the RAG pipeline, but does not elaborate on how sentiment '
              'analysis contributes to the overall accuracy verification '
              'process. Providing more detail on the interplay between these '
              'components would enhance the response.\n'
              '\n'
              '3. The explanation of the accuracy verification process could '
              'be more structured. The candidate mentions retrieving the '
              'contents of the first two articles but does not specify how '
              'this information is used to calculate the accuracy percentage '
              "of the candidate's answers. A clearer connection between the "
              'retrieval process and the accuracy assessment would strengthen '

              'Overall, the candidate demonstrates relevant experience with '
              'RAG pipelines, but additional clarity and detail in the '
              'explanation would improve the overall quality of the answer.',
  'interviewer': 'Hello! Thank you for taking the time to speak with me today '
                 "about the Entry-Level RAG AI Engineer role. I'd like to "
                 'start by asking you a few questions about your experience '
                 "and skills. Could you tell me about any projects you've "
                 'worked on involving retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) '
                 'pipelines?',
  'sentiment': 'For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a high '
               'level of interest (0.51) and confusion (0.33), coupled with '
               'moderate levels of awkwardness (0.16) and doubt (0.14), '
               'suggesting they were engaged but struggling to fully grasp or '
               'articulate their thoughts, which could be interpreted as a mix '
               'of enthusiasm and uncertainty in an interview setting.'},
 {'candidate': ' Yes, so to improve the context or the retrieval quality of '
               'the rag pipeline, I had to break down the answer from the '
               'candidate into searchable strings with the help of an LLM. So '
               "let's say an answer can be broken down into six query strings. "
               'Each of these six query strings would then be used to search '
               'in Google and we would draw the context from the first two web '
               'pages. So in a total we would get the information from a total '
               'of 12 web pages for one answer. So this I think is plenty of '
               'information to feed the LLM. This answer, this document would '
               'then be stored in a vector store and when the LLM would be '
               'queried on a specific topic or like when the LLM wanted to '
               'verify the accuracy of a certain answer it would then use a '
               'cosine similarity to find out the relevant portions of the '
               'vector store that are relevant to the answer. And doing this, '
               'it would vastly improve the quality of the answers fetched. I '
               'got this from a paper written by Google called Query '
               'Decomposition. This was the technique they used and this '
               'overcame the shortcomings of just searching for two or three '
               'websites instead of getting a more holistic picture of the '

              '1. The candidate provides a clear explanation of how they '
              'implemented the RAG pipeline by breaking down answers into '
              'searchable strings and using Google to retrieve relevant '
              'information. This demonstrates a solid understanding of the '
              'retrieval process.\n'
              '\n'
              '2. The candidate mentions using cosine similarity to find '
              'relevant portions of the vector store, which is a good approach '
              'for improving context relevance. However, it would be '
              'beneficial to elaborate on how the retrieved information is '
              "integrated into the LLM's context for generating a response. "
              'This connection could enhance the clarity of the explanation.\n'
              '\n'
              '3. The reference to the Google paper on Query Decomposition is '
              'a strong point, as it shows the candidate is informed about '
              'existing methodologies. However, it would be helpful to briefly '
              'explain how this technique specifically addresses the '
              'challenges faced in their implementation.\n'
              '\n'
              '4. The candidate does not mention any specific challenges '
              'encountered during the implementation of the RAG pipeline, such '
              'as issues with retrieval quality or context relevance. '
              'Including examples of challenges faced and how they were '
              'addressed would provide a more comprehensive view of their '
              'experience.\n'

              'Overall, the candidate demonstrates relevant experience and a '

              'on the integration of retrieved information and specific '

  'interviewer': "That's an interesting project. Can you elaborate on the "

               'interest (0.288), and satisfaction (0.226), suggesting they '

               'the interview.'},
 {'candidate': ' For model selection, we chose JATGBD 4.0 mini mainly because '
               'we used Langchain to implement the rank pipeline and GPT 4.0 '
               'mini had the perfect balance of intelligence and cost '
               'effectiveness and also speed that we had to manage. And this '
               'was just to verify the answer. So we did not go for a more '
               'sophisticated model such as Claude SONET 3.5 which is '
               'considered the most intelligent LLM till now. We did not need '
               'such a high powered LLM, we just needed a cost effective LLM '
               'to just verify the answer and make searchable strings and '
               'JATGBD 4.0 mini was perfect for the job. Apart from this, for '
               'prompt engineering, yes, I had to write several prompts to '
               'give the last rank pipeline to verify the answer. So what '
               'would happen is when we converted speech to text from the '

               'typographical errors which is common for most text translation '
               'apps. So to overcome this, I had to prompt the LLM to '

               'words that were not properly converted but were close to the '

              '1. The candidate mentions selecting "JATGBD 4.0 mini" for the '
              'RAG pipeline, but there is no widely recognized model by that '
              'name in the context of large language models. This could be a '

              'However, the context provided indicates that "GPT-4o" is a more '

              '3. The candidate mentions not needing a more sophisticated '
              'model like "Claude SONET 3.5," but the context suggests that '
              '"Claude 3.5 Sonnet" is the correct name. This discrepancy '

               'determine which model best suited the specific area of our '
               'project. So for example, for the real time conversation where '
               'the LLM had to generate questions and interact with the '
               'candidate, we went with Claude 3.5 Sonnet which is the most '

 'position.\n'
 '\n'
 '8. Enthusiasm and Engagement:\n'
 'The sentiment analysis indicates high levels of concentration, interest, and '
 'contemplation throughout the interview, suggesting genuine enthusiasm for '
 'the field.\n'
 '\n'
 'Red Flags:\n'
 '1. Some inconsistencies in naming models (e.g., "JATGBD 4.0 mini" instead of '
 '"ChatGPT 4.0 mini") which could indicate a lack of attention to detail or '
 'misunderstanding of industry-standard terminology.\n'
 '2. Limited experience in model optimization, which was directly asked about '
 'but not fully addressed.\n'
