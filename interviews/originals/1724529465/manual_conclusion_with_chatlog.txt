              '1. The candidate mentioned they have been working as a '
              'receptionist at the University of Kent for a year, which is '
              'relevant to the question. However, they did not elaborate on '
              'their specific responsibilities or skills gained in that role, '
              'which would have strengthened their response.\n'
              '2. The candidate stated that they have only had one '
              'receptionist role, which is accurate based on the information '
              'provided. However, they also mentioned experience in '
              '"customizing jobs" and working as a support engineer in IT. '
              'This part of the answer is somewhat vague and does not clearly '
              'relate to customer service or reception roles, which could lead '
              'to confusion about its relevance.\n'
              '3. The candidate could improve their answer by providing more '
              'details about their customer service skills and how they apply '
              'to the receptionist position, as this was the focus of the '
              'question. \n'

              '\n'
              '1. The candidate accurately described their duties as a '
              'receptionist, including booking rooms, configuring fobs, '
              'managing customer queries, and acting as a point of contact for '
              'housekeeping and maintenance. This aligns well with the '
              'responsibilities typically expected in a receptionist role, '
              'particularly in a university setting.\n'
              '\n'
              '2. The mention of managing customer queries regarding household '
              'items and broken furniture is relevant and demonstrates their '
              'problem-solving skills. However, the answer could have been '
              'improved by explicitly stating how they handled these queries '
              'or any specific examples of challenges faced.\n'
              '\n'
              '3. The candidate provided information about guiding guests to '
              'nearby amenities, which is a valuable aspect of customer '
              'service. However, they could have elaborated on how they '
              'ensured guest satisfaction or any feedback received from '
              'guests, which would have strengthened their response.\n'
              '\n'
              '4. The answer could benefit from a clearer structure, as it '
              'currently feels a bit rushed and could be more organized. This '
              'would help in conveying their experience more effectively.\n'

              "Overall, while the candidate's response is relevant and "
              'contains accurate information about their role, additional '
              'details and a more structured presentation would enhance the '
              'clarity and impact of their answer.',

              '1. The candidate stated that they generally go to their shift '
              'at 9 AM and mentioned their punctuality, which is relevant. '
              'However, they did not directly address their feelings about '
              'early morning shifts, which was a key part of the question. '
              'This omission affects the overall accuracy of the response.\n'
              '\n'
              '2. The candidate mentioned their current shift hours (9 AM to 2 '
              'PM) and their status as a student, which provides context but '
              'does not directly relate to the question about early morning '
              'shifts. They could have expressed their willingness or ability '

              '3. While the candidate claimed to be punctual, they did not '
              'provide specific examples or evidence of their punctuality in '
              'previous roles, which would have strengthened their response. '
              'Instead, they mentioned working from 9 AM to 5 PM and sometimes '
              'extending hours, but this does not clearly demonstrate '
              'punctuality.\n'

              '4. The response could have been more concise and focused on the '
              "question asked. The candidate's answer felt somewhat disjointed "
              'and could benefit from a clearer structure that directly '
              'addresses both parts of the question regarding early morning '
              'shifts and punctuality.\n'
              '\n'
              'Overall, while the candidate provided some relevant '
              'information, the lack of direct answers to the specific '
              'questions asked and the need for more concrete examples of '
              'punctuality impacted the accuracy of their response.',
  'interviewer': 'Thank you for providing those details. Your experience '

              '**Feedback:**\n'
              '\n'
              '1. The candidate described a situation involving a double '
              'booking, which is relevant to the question about handling '
              'difficult situations while maintaining professionalism. '
              'However, the explanation was somewhat unclear and lacked '
              'structure, making it difficult to follow the sequence of '
              'events.\n'

              '2. The candidate mentioned taking responsibility for the '
              'situation, which is a positive aspect, but they did not clearly '
              'articulate the steps they took to resolve the issue or how they '
              'communicated with the customers. Providing specific actions '
              'taken would have strengthened their response.\n'
              '\n'
              '3. The candidate referenced their experience as a support '
              'engineer and handling software complaints, but this part of the '
              'answer felt disconnected from the main example of the double '

              '4. The candidate did mention listening to customer complaints '
              'and maintaining an apologetic tone, which is important for '
              'professionalism. However, they could have elaborated on how '

              '\n'
              '5. Overall, while the candidate provided relevant examples of '

CONCLUSION :
('Thank you for providing the interview transcript and additional information. '
 "I'll now evaluate the candidate based on the provided data and give you a "
 'detailed breakdown of my decision.\n'
 '\n'
 '1. Relevant Experience:\n'
 'The candidate has one year of experience as a receptionist at the University '
 'of Kent, which is directly relevant to the Entry-Level Morning Receptionist '
 'position. They also have experience in IT support, which could be beneficial '
 'for handling technical issues that may arise in the role.\n'
 '\n'
 '2. Responsibilities and Skills:\n'
 'The candidate demonstrated a good understanding of receptionist duties, '
 'including booking rooms, managing access, handling customer queries, and '
 'providing information to guests. These skills align well with the '
 'requirements of the position.\n'
 '\n'
 '3. Communication Skills:\n'
 'Throughout the interview, the candidate showed a willingness to engage and '
 'provide detailed responses. However, their communication could be improved '
 'in terms of clarity and structure. Some responses were somewhat disjointed, '
 'which might be a concern for a role that requires excellent communication '
 'skills.\n'
 '\n'
 '4. Punctuality and Early Mornings:\n'
 "The candidate's current shift starts at 9 AM, and they claim to be punctual. "
 "However, they didn't directly address their ability or willingness to start "
 'at 8:30 AM, which is a requirement for this position. This could be a '
 'potential red flag.\n'
 '\n'
 '5. Handling Difficult Situations:\n'
 'The candidate provided examples of handling challenging situations, such as '
 'a double booking and software complaints. While they mentioned taking '
 'responsibility and maintaining an apologetic tone, their explanation lacked '
 'clarity and specific steps taken to resolve issues.\n'
 '\n'
 '6. Attitude and Enthusiasm:\n'
 'The sentiment analysis suggests that the candidate showed interest, '
 'gratitude, and calmness throughout the interview. However, their final '
 'response of "Thank you, goodbye" was overly brief and didn\'t convey '
 'enthusiasm about the opportunity.\n'
 '\n'
 '7. Accuracy of Responses:\n'
 "The feedback on the candidate's responses indicates varying levels of "
 'accuracy, ranging from 60% to 80% for most answers. This suggests that while '
 'the candidate provided relevant information, there were some gaps in '
 'addressing specific questions or providing detailed examples.\n'
 '\n'
 'Conclusion:\n'
 'The candidate has relevant experience and a basic understanding of '
 'receptionist duties. However, there are concerns about their communication '
 'skills, ability to start early shifts, and the level of enthusiasm '
 'displayed. The responses lacked the clarity and professionalism expected for '
 'a role that requires excellent communication and customer service skills.\n'
 '\n'
 'Given the high volume of candidates and the requirement to pass only 47% of '
 'candidates, I believe this candidate does not meet the threshold for moving '
 'forward in the process.\n'
 '\n'
 'fail')
