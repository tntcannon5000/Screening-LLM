        "interviewer": "That's great to hear. Let's begin our discussion about the Entry Level Receptionist role. Could you tell me about any previous experience you have in customer service or hospitality?",
        "candidate": " Yes, sure. I'm working at the University of Kent as a part-time receptionist while I'm completing my masters and previous to this I was also employed in customer facing roles in IT companies. I worked for two years as a support engineer liaising with clients and solving high problem issues that arose when their software was not running.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited strong positive emotions, particularly contentment (0.579), satisfaction (0.573), and gratitude (0.534), along with a calm demeanor (0.277) and moderate joy (0.201), indicating a highly favorable and appreciative attitude during this part of the interview, which would likely be viewed positively by potential employers.",
        "feedback": "Accuracy Score: 90%\n\nFeedback: The candidate provided relevant experience related to customer service, mentioning their current role as a part-time receptionist at the University of Kent and previous experience as a support engineer in IT companies. However, the answer could have been more focused on hospitality-specific experience, as the question pertains to an Entry Level Receptionist role in a hotel setting. While the candidate's experience in customer-facing roles is valuable, it would have been beneficial to elaborate on any direct experience in hospitality or similar environments. Additionally, the mention of \"solving high problem issues\" could be rephrased for clarity, as it may not clearly convey the nature of the customer service skills relevant to the receptionist role."

        "interviewer": "Thank you for sharing that information. Your experience as a part-time receptionist at the University of Kent is certainly relevant. Could you describe some of your key responsibilities in that role?",
        "candidate": " Sure, some of my key responsibilities include welcoming guests, preparing fobs for the guests so that they have access to their particular corridors, kitchens and rooms. Also, I am in charge of booking guests who have not booked through the web portal and directly come to the reception to get a room. Also, I am in charge of coordinating between guests and housekeeping staff and the estate staff should any problems arise for the particular guests such as broken windows, heaters not working or bed sheets not done in the day to name a few.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a balanced and positive demeanor, characterized by high levels of concentration (0.29), calmness (0.27), and satisfaction (0.26), along with moderate levels of interest (0.16), contentment (0.16), and determination (0.15), suggesting a focused and composed approach to the interview question without displaying any significant negative emotions or toxic behaviors.",
        "feedback": "Accuracy Score: 95%\n\nFeedback: The candidate provided a detailed description of their responsibilities as a part-time receptionist at the University of Kent, which is relevant to the role being discussed. They mentioned welcoming guests, preparing access fobs, booking rooms for walk-in guests, and coordinating with housekeeping and estate staff regarding guest issues. \n\nHowever, the answer could be improved by explicitly mentioning how they handle guest complaints or issues, as this is a critical aspect of a receptionist's role in hospitality. While they did mention coordinating with staff for problems like broken windows and heaters, elaborating on their approach to resolving guest complaints would align better with the expectations for a receptionist in a hotel setting. Additionally, the phrase \"should any problems arise for the particular guests\" could be rephrased for clarity, as it may not clearly convey the proactive nature of addressing guest concerns. \n\nOverall, the response is strong but could benefit from a more explicit connection to guest complaint handling, which is a key component of the hospitality industry."

        "interviewer": "I see. Thank you for that overview. In this role at Hilton, you'd be working with a diverse range of guests. How do you handle difficult or upset customers?",
        "candidate": " Yes, so I handle upset customers. When any issues arise as a receptionist, you have to take the responsibility on yourself. On such incident, I can call back from memory is when a guest showed up to reception because their room was double booked. We had to calm the guest down. By we, I mean I had to calm the guest down and be apologetic to the guest since this happened because double bookings weren't the fault of the booking agent but a fault in the software itself. I had to explain to the guest the best I can about the situation and then I had to book a separate room for the guest for the remainder of their stay. Thank you.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited strong signs of annoyance (0.63) and disappointment (0.21), coupled with moderate levels of disapproval (0.28), determination (0.19), and tiredness (0.12), suggesting a frustrated and somewhat negative emotional state during this part of the interview, which could potentially be concerning for their suitability for the position.",
        "feedback": "Accuracy Score: 85%\n\nFeedback: The candidate's response demonstrates a good understanding of how to handle upset customers, particularly in the context of a double booking situation. They mentioned taking responsibility, calming the guest down, and explaining the situation, which aligns with best practices in customer service.\n\nHowever, the answer could be improved by incorporating more specific techniques for handling difficult customers, such as validating the guest's feelings, offering a solution, and following up to ensure satisfaction. While the candidate did mention apologizing and explaining the situation, they did not explicitly state how they validated the guest's feelings or reassured them, which is crucial in de-escalating conflicts. Additionally, the response could benefit from a more structured approach, outlining the steps taken to resolve the issue clearly. \n\nOverall, while the candidate's experience is relevant, the answer lacks some depth in terms of specific strategies for managing difficult customer interactions effectively."

        "interviewer": "Thank you for sharing that experience. One last question: The Hilton receptionist role requires knowledge of hotel facilities and room categories. How would you go about familiarizing yourself with these aspects if you were to join our team?",
        "candidate": " I would ask the people already present and staff about the layout of the hotel and I would myself visit each and every corridor of the most important parts of the hotel to get familiarized with the layout so that I can interact with the guests accordingly and some of the hidden parts or corridors throughout the hotel I will get acclimatized I will get used to them as and when I receive complaints on the job so basically get familiarized with the main layout and then if any niche scenarios arise I will get familiarized with them on the job.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a high level of annoyance (0.66) and disappointment (0.34), along with notable levels of disapproval (0.28) and contempt (0.12), suggesting a negative emotional state that could be perceived as unfavorable in an interview setting, despite showing some concentration (0.10) and determination (0.11).",
        "feedback": "**Accuracy Score: 75%**\n\n**Feedback:**\n\n1. **Familiarization Approach**: The candidate mentioned asking existing staff and visiting important parts of the hotel to familiarize themselves with the layout. While this is a good start, the answer lacks a structured approach to learning about hotel facilities and room categories. It would be beneficial to include specific methods such as reviewing hotel documentation, attending training sessions, or shadowing experienced staff members to gain a comprehensive understanding.\n\n2. **Proactive Learning**: The candidate stated they would get acclimatized to hidden parts or corridors as complaints arise. This reactive approach may not be the most effective way to familiarize oneself with the hotel. A more proactive strategy, such as taking the initiative to learn about common guest concerns and how to address them before they arise, would demonstrate a stronger commitment to guest service.\n\n3. **Guest Interaction**: The response could have emphasized the importance of understanding hotel facilities and room categories in relation to guest interactions. For example, knowing the features of different room types can enhance the candidate's ability to recommend accommodations to guests effectively.\n\n4. **Clarity and Structure**: The answer is somewhat convoluted and could benefit from clearer structure. Breaking down the response into distinct steps or methods for familiarization would improve clarity and make it easier for the interviewer to follow the candidate's thought process.\n\nOverall, while the candidate's intention to learn and adapt is evident, the response could be strengthened by incorporating more specific strategies and a proactive mindset towards familiarizing themselves with hotel operations."
