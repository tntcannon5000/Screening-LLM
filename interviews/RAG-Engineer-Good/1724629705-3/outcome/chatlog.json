        "interviewer": "Hello! Thank you for taking the time to speak with me today about the Entry-Level RAG AI Engineer role. I'd like to start by asking you a few questions about your experience and skills. Could you tell me about any projects you've worked on involving retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines?",
        "candidate": " I'm sure so I'm studying artificial intelligence at the University of Kent currently and for my final dissertation. I'm working on making a automated screening Interview agent and to implement this I have used a rag pipeline mainly as the accuracy verifier so what happens is when the Candidate answers their questions it goes through two pipelines one is the sentiment analysis and one is the accuracy verifier For the accuracy verifier I have implemented a retrieval augmented generation, which would basically break down the answer into separate Searchable strings which will then be searched on Google and The first two articles it will retrieve the contents of the first two articles and input that in the context of the LLM So the LM has more up-to-date information to verify with the whether the answer from the candidate is accurate or not and to give an accuracy percentage",
        "feedback": "**Accuracy Percentage:** 85%\n\n**Feedback:**\n\n1. The candidate provided a relevant project involving a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline, which is a positive aspect of the answer. They described using RAG for an automated screening interview agent, which aligns well with the question.\n\n2. The explanation of how the RAG pipeline functions is mostly clear, but there are some areas that could be improved for clarity:\n   - The phrase \"break down the answer into separate Searchable strings\" could be more precise. It would be beneficial to clarify how the breakdown process works and what criteria are used for creating these strings.\n   - The mention of \"searching on Google\" may imply a lack of control over the sources being retrieved. It would be more effective to specify if there are any filters or criteria for selecting the articles to ensure the reliability of the information.\n\n3. The candidate mentions using sentiment analysis alongside the accuracy verifier, but does not elaborate on how sentiment analysis contributes to the overall process. Providing a brief explanation of its role would enhance the understanding of the project.\n\n4. The overall structure of the answer could be improved for better readability. Breaking the response into shorter sentences or using bullet points for key components of the project could help convey the information more effectively.\n\nOverall, the candidate demonstrates a solid understanding of RAG pipelines and their application in a practical project, but some areas could benefit from additional detail and clarity."

        "interviewer": "That's an interesting project. Can you elaborate on the specific challenges you faced while implementing the RAG pipeline for your accuracy verifier? How did you address issues like retrieval quality or context relevance?",
        "candidate": " Yes, so to improve the context or the retrieval quality of the rag pipeline, I had to break down the answer from the candidate into searchable strings with the help of an LLM. So let's say an answer can be broken down into six query strings. Each of these six query strings would then be used to search in Google and we would draw the context from the first two web pages. So in a total we would get the information from a total of 12 web pages for one answer. So this I think is plenty of information to feed the LLM. This answer, this document would then be stored in a vector store and when the LLM would be queried on a specific topic or like when the LLM wanted to verify the accuracy of a certain answer it would then use a cosine similarity to find out the relevant portions of the vector store that are relevant to the answer. And doing this, it would vastly improve the quality of the answers fetched. I got this from a paper written by Google called Query Decomposition. This was the technique they used and this overcame the shortcomings of just searching for two or three websites instead of getting a more holistic picture of the entire topics being discussed in the answer.",
        "feedback": "**Accuracy Percentage:** 90%\n\n**Feedback:**\n\n1. The candidate provided a relevant and detailed explanation of how they implemented the RAG pipeline for their accuracy verifier. They described breaking down the candidate's answers into searchable strings, which is a key aspect of improving retrieval quality.\n\n2. The explanation of using six query strings to search Google and retrieving context from the first two web pages is clear. However, it would be beneficial to specify if there are any criteria or filters applied to ensure the reliability of the sources being retrieved. This would address potential concerns about the quality of information sourced from Google.\n\n3. The candidate mentioned storing the retrieved information in a vector store and using cosine similarity for relevance, which is a good approach. However, they could have elaborated on how the cosine similarity is calculated and how it contributes to determining the relevance of the retrieved information.\n\n4. The reference to the Google paper on Query Decomposition is a strong point, as it shows the candidate's engagement with existing research. However, it would enhance the answer if they briefly explained how this technique specifically improved their implementation compared to previous methods.\n\n5. The candidate did not elaborate on the role of sentiment analysis in the overall process, which was mentioned in the previous answer. Providing a brief explanation of how sentiment analysis interacts with the accuracy verification process would improve clarity.\n\nOverall, the candidate demonstrates a solid understanding of the RAG pipeline and its application in their project, with only minor areas for improvement in clarity and detail."

    {
        "interviewer": "That's a sophisticated approach. How did you handle the integration of this RAG pipeline with the large language model? Were there any specific challenges in terms of prompt engineering or model selection?",
        "candidate": " For model selection, we chose JATGBD 4.0 mini mainly because we used Langchain to implement the rank pipeline and GPT 4.0 mini had the perfect balance of intelligence and cost effectiveness and also speed that we had to manage. And this was just to verify the answer. So we did not go for a more sophisticated model such as Claude SONET 3.5 which is considered the most intelligent LLM till now. We did not need such a high powered LLM, we just needed a cost effective LLM to just verify the answer and make searchable strings and JATGBD 4.0 mini was perfect for the job. Apart from this, for prompt engineering, yes, I had to write several prompts to give the last rank pipeline to verify the answer. So what would happen is when we converted speech to text from the interview, some of the text had grammatical errors or typographical errors which is common for most text translation apps. So to overcome this, I had to prompt the LLM to specifically overlook grammatical errors or to make sense of words that were not properly converted but were close to the actual word that the candidate was trying to explain. So these were some of the challenges that I faced.",
        "feedback": "**Accuracy Percentage:** 85%\n\n**Feedback:**\n\n1. The candidate provided a relevant explanation regarding model selection, stating that they chose JATGBD 4.0 mini due to its balance of intelligence, cost-effectiveness, and speed. However, the mention of \"GPT 4.0 mini\" seems to be a transcription error, as it should likely refer to \"JATGBD 4.0 mini\" throughout. This could lead to confusion about the model being discussed.\n\n2. The candidate's rationale for not selecting a more sophisticated model like Claude SONET 3.5 is valid, but it could be enhanced by briefly explaining the specific requirements of their project that made JATGBD 4.0 mini sufficient.\n\n3. The explanation of prompt engineering is generally clear, but it would benefit from more detail on the types of prompts used and how they specifically addressed the challenges of grammatical and typographical errors in the transcribed text. This would provide a clearer picture of the candidate's approach to overcoming these challenges.\n\n4. The candidate mentioned prompting the LLM to overlook grammatical errors, but it would be helpful to elaborate on how this was achieved in practice. For instance, did they use specific prompt structures or techniques to guide the model's understanding?\n\n5. Overall, while the candidate demonstrates a solid understanding of the integration of the RAG pipeline with the LLM, providing more specific examples and clarifications would enhance the clarity and depth of their response."

    {
        "interviewer": "Thank you for sharing those details. Can you discuss any experience you have with optimizing model performance, particularly in terms of speed and cost efficiency?",
        "candidate": " So far I have not optimized any model. By optimizing I am thinking you mean fine tuning model. So for the specific project fine tuning was not necessary. However, we had to determine which model best suited the specific area of our project. So for example, for the real time conversation where the LLM had to generate questions and interact with the candidate, we went with Claude 3.5 Sonnet which is the most intelligent LLM till date as preferred by most developers. And again for the accuracy verifier we went with ChatGPD 4.0 Mini which is a cut down version of ChatGPD 4.0 which itself is a very powerful LLM. However, 4.0 Mini has the right balance of intelligence and cost effectiveness and also speed. Then for the sentiment analysis we went with Hume AI which is an external service that does the sentiment analysis directly from audio and video feed. So the service, we don't know the specific implementation of the service because we are paying to use the service. And after that getting the sentiment and accuracy verifier score we then feed it into Claude Sonnet 3.5 again to make sense of the answers that the candidate made from both the accuracy verifier and from the sentiment analysis and to give the final verdict of the candidate. So these are the main considerations we made when choosing an LLM.",
        "feedback": "**Accuracy Percentage:** 80%\n\n**Feedback:**\n\n1. The candidate states that they have not optimized any model, which is accurate in the context of their specific project. However, they could have elaborated on any considerations or strategies they might have used to ensure speed and cost efficiency when selecting models, even if they did not perform optimization themselves.\n\n2. The candidate mentions choosing Claude 3.5 Sonnet for real-time conversation and ChatGPD 4.0 Mini for the accuracy verifier. While they provide reasoning for these choices, they could have included more detail on how these models specifically contributed to speed and cost efficiency in their project. For instance, discussing any performance metrics or comparisons would strengthen their response.\n\n3. The mention of Hume AI for sentiment analysis is relevant, but the candidate does not explain how the integration of this service impacts overall model performance in terms of speed and cost. Providing insight into the trade-offs or benefits of using an external service would enhance the answer.\n\n4. The candidate states that they do not know the specific implementation of the Hume AI service because they are paying to use it. While this is understandable, it would be beneficial to discuss any considerations they made regarding the reliability or efficiency of using an external service versus an in-house solution.\n\n5. The overall structure of the answer could be improved for clarity. Breaking down the response into clearer sections or bullet points for each model and its specific contributions to speed and cost efficiency would help convey the information more effectively. \n\nOverall, while the candidate demonstrates a solid understanding of model selection and its implications, there are areas where additional detail and clarity could improve the response."
