        "interviewer": "Hello! Thank you for taking the time to speak with me today about the Entry-Level RAG AI Engineer role. I'd like to start by asking you a few questions about your experience and skills. Could you tell me about any projects you've worked on involving retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines?",
        "candidate": " I'm sure so I'm studying artificial intelligence at the University of Kent currently and for my final dissertation. I'm working on making a automated screening Interview agent and to implement this I have used a rag pipeline mainly as the accuracy verifier so what happens is when the Candidate answers their questions it goes through two pipelines one is the sentiment analysis and one is the accuracy verifier For the accuracy verifier I have implemented a retrieval augmented generation, which would basically break down the answer into separate Searchable strings which will then be searched on Google and The first two articles it will retrieve the contents of the first two articles and input that in the context of the LLM So the LM has more up-to-date information to verify with the whether the answer from the candidate is accurate or not and to give an accuracy percentage",
        "feedback": "**Accuracy Percentage:** 85%\n\n**Feedback:**\n\n1. The candidate provided a relevant project involving a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline, which is a positive aspect of their answer. They described using RAG for an automated screening interview agent, which aligns well with the question.\n\n2. The explanation of how the RAG pipeline functions is mostly clear, but there are some areas that could be more precise. For instance, the candidate mentions breaking down the answer into \"separate searchable strings\" and searching on Google. While this is a valid approach, it would be beneficial to clarify how the retrieved articles are processed and integrated into the LLM's context. The explanation could be more structured to enhance clarity.\n\n3. The candidate states that the RAG pipeline is used as an \"accuracy verifier.\" While this is a valid use case, it would be helpful to elaborate on how the accuracy percentage is calculated and what criteria are used to determine the accuracy of the candidate's answers.\n\n4. The phrase \"the first two articles it will retrieve the contents of the first two articles\" is somewhat redundant and could be streamlined for better clarity.\n\nOverall, the candidate demonstrates a solid understanding of RAG pipelines and their application in a practical project, but there is room for improvement in clarity and detail regarding the implementation and evaluation aspects."

        "interviewer": "That's an interesting project. Can you elaborate on the specific challenges you faced while implementing the RAG pipeline for your accuracy verifier? How did you address issues like retrieval quality or context relevance?",
        "candidate": " Yes, so to improve the context or the retrieval quality of the rag pipeline, I had to break down the answer from the candidate into searchable strings with the help of an LLM. So let's say an answer can be broken down into six query strings. Each of these six query strings would then be used to search in Google and we would draw the context from the first two web pages. So in a total we would get the information from a total of 12 web pages for one answer. So this I think is plenty of information to feed the LLM. This answer, this document would then be stored in a vector store and when the LLM would be queried on a specific topic or like when the LLM wanted to verify the accuracy of a certain answer it would then use a cosine similarity to find out the relevant portions of the vector store that are relevant to the answer. And doing this, it would vastly improve the quality of the answers fetched. I got this from a paper written by Google called Query Decomposition. This was the technique they used and this overcame the shortcomings of just searching for two or three websites instead of getting a more holistic picture of the entire topics being discussed in the answer.",
        "feedback": "**Accuracy Percentage:** 90%\n\n**Feedback:**\n\n1. The candidate effectively elaborated on the challenges faced while implementing the RAG pipeline, specifically addressing retrieval quality and context relevance. They described breaking down the candidate's answer into searchable strings, which is a valid approach to enhance retrieval quality.\n\n2. The explanation of using six query strings to search Google and retrieving context from the first two web pages is clear. However, it would be beneficial to clarify how the information from these web pages is processed and integrated into the LLM's context. This detail would enhance the understanding of the retrieval process.\n\n3. The candidate mentioned storing the retrieved documents in a vector store and using cosine similarity to find relevant portions. This is a good approach, but it would be helpful to elaborate on how the cosine similarity is calculated and how it contributes to improving the accuracy verification process.\n\n4. The reference to the Google paper on Query Decomposition is a strong point, as it shows the candidate's engagement with relevant literature. However, it would be beneficial to briefly explain how this technique specifically addresses the shortcomings of searching only two or three websites.\n\nOverall, the candidate demonstrates a solid understanding of the RAG pipeline and its application in their project, with only minor areas for improvement in clarity and detail regarding the integration and evaluation processes."

        "interviewer": "That's a sophisticated approach. How did you handle the integration of this RAG pipeline with the large language model? Were there any specific challenges in terms of prompt engineering or model selection?",
        "candidate": " For model selection, we chose JATGBD 4.0 mini mainly because we used Langchain to implement the rank pipeline and GPT 4.0 mini had the perfect balance of intelligence and cost effectiveness and also speed that we had to manage. And this was just to verify the answer. So we did not go for a more sophisticated model such as Claude SONET 3.5 which is considered the most intelligent LLM till now. We did not need such a high powered LLM, we just needed a cost effective LLM to just verify the answer and make searchable strings and JATGBD 4.0 mini was perfect for the job. Apart from this, for prompt engineering, yes, I had to write several prompts to give the last rank pipeline to verify the answer. So what would happen is when we converted speech to text from the interview, some of the text had grammatical errors or typographical errors which is common for most text translation apps. So to overcome this, I had to prompt the LLM to specifically overlook grammatical errors or to make sense of words that were not properly converted but were close to the actual word that the candidate was trying to explain. So these were some of the challenges that I faced.",
        "feedback": "**Accuracy Percentage:** 85%\n\n**Feedback:**\n\n1. The candidate provided a clear rationale for model selection, stating that they chose JATGBD 4.0 mini due to its balance of intelligence, cost-effectiveness, and speed. However, the mention of \"GPT 4.0 mini\" seems to be a transcription error, as it should likely refer to \"JATGBD 4.0 mini\" throughout. This could lead to confusion regarding the model being discussed.\n\n2. The candidate effectively explained the challenges faced in prompt engineering, particularly regarding grammatical and typographical errors in the speech-to-text conversion. They described how they prompted the LLM to overlook these errors, which is a valid approach. However, it would be beneficial to provide more detail on the specific types of prompts used and how they were structured to address these issues.\n\n3. The candidate mentioned that they did not require a more sophisticated model like Claude SONET 3.5, which is a reasonable decision based on their project needs. However, it would enhance the answer to briefly explain why the chosen model was sufficient for their specific use case, particularly in terms of the tasks it needed to perform.\n\n4. The explanation of the integration of the RAG pipeline with the LLM could be more structured. While the candidate mentioned the process of converting speech to text and the subsequent challenges, a clearer outline of how the RAG pipeline interacts with the LLM during the verification process would improve clarity.\n\nOverall, the candidate demonstrates a solid understanding of the integration of the RAG pipeline with the LLM, but there are areas for improvement in clarity and detail regarding the prompt engineering and the rationale behind model selection."

        "interviewer": "Thank you for sharing those details. Can you discuss any experience you have with optimizing model performance, particularly in terms of speed and cost efficiency?",
        "candidate": " So far I have not optimized any model. By optimizing I am thinking you mean fine tuning model. So for the specific project fine tuning was not necessary. However, we had to determine which model best suited the specific area of our project. So for example, for the real time conversation where the LLM had to generate questions and interact with the candidate, we went with Claude 3.5 Sonnet which is the most intelligent LLM till date as preferred by most developers. And again for the accuracy verifier we went with ChatGPD 4.0 Mini which is a cut down version of ChatGPD 4.0 which itself is a very powerful LLM. However, 4.0 Mini has the right balance of intelligence and cost effectiveness and also speed. Then for the sentiment analysis we went with Hume AI which is an external service that does the sentiment analysis directly from audio and video feed. So the service, we don't know the specific implementation of the service because we are paying to use the service. And after that getting the sentiment and accuracy verifier score we then feed it into Claude Sonnet 3.5 again to make sense of the answers that the candidate made from both the accuracy verifier and from the sentiment analysis and to give the final verdict of the candidate. So these are the main considerations we made when choosing an LLM.",
        "feedback": "**Accuracy Percentage:** 80%\n\n**Feedback:**\n\n1. The candidate stated, \"So far I have not optimized any model,\" which indicates a lack of direct experience with model optimization. While they interpreted \"optimizing\" as \"fine-tuning,\" it would have been beneficial to clarify that optimization can also include other aspects such as model selection, cost efficiency, and speed, which they did discuss later in their answer.\n\n2. The candidate mentioned selecting Claude 3.5 Sonnet for real-time conversation and ChatGPD 4.0 Mini for the accuracy verifier. However, they did not elaborate on how these choices specifically contributed to optimizing model performance in terms of speed and cost efficiency. More detail on the decision-making process regarding these models and their performance metrics would enhance the answer.\n\n3. The candidate stated that \"4.0 Mini has the right balance of intelligence and cost effectiveness and also speed.\" While this is a valid point, they did not provide specific examples or metrics to support this claim. Including such details would strengthen their argument regarding cost efficiency and speed.\n\n4. The mention of using Hume AI for sentiment analysis is relevant, but the candidate did not explain how this choice impacted the overall optimization of the model performance. A brief discussion on the cost and speed implications of using an external service would have added depth to their answer.\n\n5. The candidate's explanation of feeding the sentiment and accuracy verifier scores back into Claude Sonnet 3.5 to derive a final verdict is a good point. However, they could have elaborated on how this process contributes to optimizing the overall model performance, particularly in terms of efficiency and accuracy.\n\nOverall, while the candidate provided relevant information regarding model selection and considerations for speed and cost efficiency, they could improve their answer by providing more specific examples, metrics, and a clearer connection between their choices and the optimization of model performance."
