        "interviewer": "Hello! Thank you for taking the time to speak with me today about the Entry Level RAG Engineer role. I'd like to start our conversation with a question: What is the most up-to-date LLM, and which company developed it?",
        "candidate": " I'm sure. So the most up-to-date LLMs are Cloud 3.5 Sonnet that is C-L-A-U-D-E 3.5 Sonnet developed by Anthropic and GPT-4-O Mini that is GPT-4-O Mini developed by OpenAI.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a predominantly neutral emotional state, with notable levels of calmness (0.19) and contentment (0.11), alongside moderate levels of contemplation (0.09), realization (0.09), and satisfaction (0.09), suggesting a composed and thoughtful demeanor during the interview, which is generally favorable in a professional setting.",
        "feedback": "The accuracy of the answer provided is 40%.\n\nInaccuracies:\n1. The term \"Cloud 3.5 Sonnet\" appears to be a transcription error or a misunderstanding. The most up-to-date LLM from Anthropic is known as \"Claude 3.5,\" not \"Cloud 3.5 Sonnet.\" This should be corrected to reflect the correct name.\n2. The term \"GPT-4-O Mini\" is not a recognized version of OpenAI's models. The latest version is GPT-4, and there is no official designation as \"GPT-4-O Mini.\" This indicates a misunderstanding or miscommunication regarding the model's name.\n\nFeedback:\n- The mention of \"Cloud 3.5 Sonnet\" should be corrected to \"Claude 3.5,\" which is the accurate name of the model developed by Anthropic.\n- The reference to \"GPT-4-O Mini\" should be clarified as it does not correspond to any known version of OpenAI's models. The candidate should be encouraged to verify the latest versions and their correct names."
