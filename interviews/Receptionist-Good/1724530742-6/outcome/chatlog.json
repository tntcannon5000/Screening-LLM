        "interviewer": "Hello! Thank you for taking the time to speak with me today about the Entry-Level Morning Receptionist (Part Time) position at our research institute. I'd like to ask you a few questions to learn more about your qualifications and interest in this role. Could you start by telling me why you're interested in this position?",
        "candidate": " Yes, sure. So I've been working as a part-time receptionist at the University of Kent for a year right now. And I think I'd be qualified in a customer-facing role such as this. Previous to this, I've also worked as a support engineer in big tech companies such as Ingram Micro and TCS, where I had to face customer queries from clients regarding whether the software is working or not. And I'll be graduating the University of Kent in two months, and after that I'm looking for a job in Cambridge, and this happens to be the perfect thing lined up for me.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a balanced mix of emotions, with notable levels of calmness (0.22), interest (0.17), and enthusiasm (0.11), suggesting they were engaged and composed during the interview, while also displaying some positive surprise (0.17) and mild amusement (0.09), which could indicate a pleasant and dynamic interaction with the interviewer.",
        "feedback": "**Accuracy Score: 85%**\n\n**Feedback:**\n\n1. The candidate mentions they have been working as a part-time receptionist for a year at the University of Kent, which is relevant experience for the role. However, they could have elaborated more on specific skills or experiences that directly relate to the responsibilities of a receptionist, such as handling phone calls, managing appointments, or dealing with customer inquiries.\n\n2. The candidate references their previous experience as a support engineer in tech companies, which demonstrates customer service skills. However, they could have connected this experience more explicitly to the skills required for a receptionist role, such as communication and organizational skills.\n\n3. The candidate states they will be graduating in two months and are looking for a job in Cambridge, which shows their motivation and geographical preference. However, they could have emphasized their interest in the specific research institute and how it aligns with their career goals, which would strengthen their response.\n\nOverall, while the candidate provides relevant experience and motivation, they could enhance their answer by making clearer connections between their past roles and the specific skills needed for the receptionist position."

        "interviewer": "Thank you for sharing that background. It's great to hear about your relevant experience. Could you tell me more about your availability? This position requires opening reception at 8:30 AM and working until 12:45 PM, Monday to Friday. Would you be able to commit to these hours?",
        "candidate": " Yes, sure. After I graduate from university, I will have permission to work 40 hours a week. And apart from that, I am very punctual. Currently, my working hours are from 9 a.m. to 2 a.m. 2 p.m. My bad. And previously, when I worked as a tech support engineer, my working hours were from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Sometimes it extended from 9 a.m. to 10 p.m. depending on heavy workloads. And I was able to deliver to those times. And I think I will be able to deliver for the part-time receptionist role at Cambridge.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited strong determination (0.62) and enthusiasm (0.60), coupled with high levels of concentration (0.19) and contemplation (0.20), suggesting a focused and passionate approach to the interview question, while also displaying notable levels of excitement (0.30) and interest (0.32), indicating an engaged and positive demeanor throughout their response.",
        "feedback": "**Accuracy Score: 70%**\n\n**Feedback:**\n\n1. The candidate states they will have permission to work 40 hours a week after graduation, which is relevant to the question about availability. However, they do not directly address the specific hours required for the receptionist position (8:30 AM to 12:45 PM, Monday to Friday). It would have been more effective if they explicitly confirmed their ability to commit to those specific hours.\n\n2. The candidate mentions their current working hours as \"from 9 a.m. to 2 a.m. 2 p.m.\" This appears to be a transcription error, and it should be clarified as \"from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m.\" This confusion could lead to misunderstandings about their current availability.\n\n3. While the candidate emphasizes their punctuality and previous work experience, they could have provided more specific examples of how their past roles have prepared them for the responsibilities of a receptionist, such as managing schedules or handling customer inquiries.\n\n4. The candidate mentions their experience as a tech support engineer and their ability to work extended hours, but they do not connect this experience to the skills needed for a receptionist role, such as communication and organizational skills. Making this connection would strengthen their response.\n\nOverall, while the candidate provides some relevant information about their work experience and availability, they need to directly address the specific hours required for the position and clarify any potential transcription errors to improve the accuracy of their response."

        "interviewer": "I see, thank you for that information. This role requires excellent communication and interpersonal skills. Can you give me an example of how you've demonstrated these skills in your previous receptionist or customer service roles?",
        "candidate": " I'm sure. I think the most important customer service or speaking skills come into focus when the customer is agitated. So one such example would be double booking the same room for two different customers. This happened one time when I was at reception even though I was not responsible for that particular booking. So the customer was very angry at the situation and when they approached reception they wanted to get answers. However, I had to take the responsibility on myself and had to have a very apologetic tone when dealing with the customer and to kind of show them that this was an error with the booking system itself not with the reception. And eventually they understood and we were able to book a new room for them. And one such situation from my time as a support engineer would be when I initially joined the role I did not know the layouts of the entire application or the pitfalls of the application I was working on and I had a really high or tense call with a customer since their transactions were not processed at a specific date. I had to get help from my senior support staff and also convince them of the technical difficulties why they could not do and there was nothing that could be done at the moment and if they allowed us two days of time we would enable the transaction and that this would not happen in the future. And the customer was convinced and they continued to use our software from there on. So these are the two circumstances that come into mind when dealing with customers in a very efficient and responsible and apologetic way to cool them down.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a balanced and positive emotional state, characterized by high levels of calmness (0.38), contentment (0.26), and satisfaction (0.36), combined with strong indicators of concentration (0.20), contemplation (0.24), and determination (0.30), suggesting a thoughtful and composed approach to the interview question.",
        "feedback": "**Accuracy Score: 75%**\n\n**Feedback:**\n\n1. The candidate provides a relevant example of handling an agitated customer due to a double booking situation. They demonstrate effective communication skills by taking responsibility and using an apologetic tone, which aligns well with the expectations for the role. However, they could have included more specific phrases or techniques they used to calm the customer, as suggested in the additional context provided.\n\n2. In the second example, while the candidate describes a tense situation with a customer as a support engineer, they do not clearly articulate how they communicated understanding and empathy, which are crucial elements in customer service interactions. They mention convincing the customer of technical difficulties, but they could have emphasized their approach to calming the customer and ensuring they felt heard.\n\n3. The candidate mentions that they had to take responsibility for the booking error, which is a good demonstration of accountability. However, they could have elaborated on how they resolved the issue beyond just booking a new room, such as any follow-up actions taken to ensure customer satisfaction.\n\n4. The candidate's response is somewhat lengthy and could benefit from being more concise. Streamlining their examples while still conveying the key points would enhance clarity and impact.\n\nOverall, while the candidate provides relevant examples of their communication and interpersonal skills, they could strengthen their response by incorporating specific techniques for managing customer emotions and ensuring customer satisfaction, as well as being more concise in their delivery."

        "interviewer": "Thank you for sharing those examples. One last question: this role requires proficiency with computer systems. Could you briefly describe your experience with various software or systems you've used in your previous roles?",
        "candidate": " I'm sure. I worked as a support engineer in Big Tech for one year. I also worked as a software developer for the last four years of my professional career. So I'm well-honed in programming skills such as Python, Java, using frameworks such as Django and Spring. I'm also well-honed in using Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, and in my current receptionist role, we use a software called Kinetics to book specific rooms and also configure fobs so that the customer has access to their room, hallway, and kitchen, and only their specific room, hallway, and kitchen and not to others. So I would say I'm pretty well-equipped to deal with computer programs.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a high level of contemplation (0.428) and interest (0.308), coupled with a sense of calmness (0.247) and satisfaction (0.230), suggesting they were thoughtfully engaged in the conversation while maintaining a composed and positive demeanor, which are generally favorable traits in an interview setting.",
        "feedback": "**Accuracy Score: 80%**\n\n**Feedback:**\n\n1. The candidate provides a solid overview of their experience with various software systems, including programming languages (Python, Java) and frameworks (Django, Spring). However, they could have elaborated on how these programming skills specifically relate to the role of a receptionist, which primarily involves administrative tasks rather than software development.\n\n2. The mention of using Microsoft Word and Excel is relevant, but the candidate could have provided specific examples of tasks they performed with these applications that would be applicable to the receptionist role, such as creating documents, managing spreadsheets, or scheduling.\n\n3. The candidate discusses their current use of Kinetics software for booking rooms and configuring access, which is a strong point. However, they could have included more details about their proficiency with this software, such as any specific features they utilize or challenges they have overcome while using it.\n\n4. The phrase \"I'm well-honed\" is somewhat informal and could be replaced with a more professional expression, such as \"I have developed strong skills\" or \"I am proficient in.\" This would enhance the professionalism of the response.\n\nOverall, while the candidate demonstrates a range of relevant software experience, they could strengthen their answer by making clearer connections between their technical skills and the specific requirements of the receptionist role, as well as providing more detailed examples of their proficiency with the software mentioned."
