        "interviewer": "Hello! Thank you for taking the time to speak with me today about the Entry-Level Morning Receptionist (Part Time) position at our research institute. I'd like to ask you a few questions to learn more about your qualifications and interest in this role. Could you start by telling me why you're interested in this position?",
        "candidate": " Yes, sure. So I've been working as a part-time receptionist at the University of Kent for a year right now. And I think I'd be qualified in a customer-facing role such as this. Previous to this, I've also worked as a support engineer in big tech companies such as Ingram Micro and TCS, where I had to face customer queries from clients regarding whether the software is working or not. And I'll be graduating the University of Kent in two months, and after that I'm looking for a job in Cambridge, and this happens to be the perfect thing lined up for me.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a notable level of calmness (0.32) and interest (0.22), along with moderate levels of positive surprise (0.16) and boredom (0.11), suggesting a composed and engaged demeanor with occasional moments of intrigue and potential disengagement, while maintaining an overall neutral to slightly positive sentiment as indicated by the higher values in the mid to upper range of the sentiment scale.",
        "feedback": "The accuracy score for the answer provided is 85%.\n\nFeedback on inaccuracies:\n\n1. **Relevance of Experience**: While the candidate mentions their experience as a part-time receptionist, which is relevant, they could have elaborated more on specific skills or tasks they performed in that role that directly relate to the responsibilities of the Entry-Level Morning Receptionist position. This would strengthen their case for being qualified for the role.\n\n2. **Connection to the Role**: The candidate states that the position is \"the perfect thing lined up for me,\" but does not clearly articulate why this specific role at the research institute aligns with their career goals or interests. Providing more insight into their motivation for applying to this particular position would enhance their response.\n\n3. **Future Plans**: The mention of graduating in two months and looking for a job in Cambridge is relevant, but it could be more effective if the candidate connected this to their interest in the receptionist position, perhaps by discussing how this role fits into their career trajectory or aspirations.\n\nOverall, the candidate's experience is relevant, but they could improve their answer by making stronger connections between their background and the specific role they are applying for."

        "interviewer": "Thank you for sharing that background. It's great to hear about your relevant experience. Could you tell me more about your availability? This position requires opening reception at 8:30 AM and working until 12:45 PM, Monday to Friday. Would you be able to commit to these hours?",
        "candidate": " Yes, sure. After I graduate from university, I will have permission to work 40 hours a week. And apart from that, I am very punctual. Currently, my working hours are from 9 a.m. to 2 a.m. 2 p.m. My bad. And previously, when I worked as a tech support engineer, my working hours were from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Sometimes it extended from 9 a.m. to 10 p.m. depending on heavy workloads. And I was able to deliver to those times. And I think I will be able to deliver for the part-time receptionist role at Cambridge.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited strong determination (0.62) and enthusiasm (0.60), coupled with high levels of concentration (0.19) and contemplation (0.20), suggesting a focused and passionate approach to the interview question, while also displaying notable interest (0.32) and excitement (0.30) which indicates a positive and engaged attitude towards the topic being discussed.",
        "feedback": "The accuracy score for the answer provided is 75%.\n\nFeedback on inaccuracies:\n\n1. **Availability Clarity**: The candidate mentions that they will have permission to work 40 hours a week after graduation, but the question specifically asks about availability for a part-time position that requires working from 8:30 AM to 12:45 PM, Monday to Friday. The candidate does not directly confirm their ability to commit to these specific hours, which is crucial for the role.\n\n2. **Current Working Hours**: The candidate states their current working hours as \"from 9 a.m. to 2 a.m. 2 p.m.\" This appears to be a transcription error, and it should be clarified as \"from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m.\" However, this confusion does not directly impact the accuracy score, as it is a transcription issue.\n\n3. **Relevance of Past Experience**: While the candidate mentions their previous experience as a tech support engineer, they do not explicitly connect this experience to the skills required for the receptionist role. Providing specific examples of how their past roles have prepared them for the responsibilities of a receptionist would strengthen their response.\n\nOverall, the candidate's answer lacks a direct confirmation of their availability for the specific hours required for the position, which is a critical aspect of the question."

        "interviewer": "I see, thank you for that information. This role requires excellent communication and interpersonal skills. Can you give me an example of how you've demonstrated these skills in your previous receptionist or customer service roles?",
        "candidate": " I'm sure. I think the most important customer service or speaking skills come into focus when the customer is agitated. So one such example would be double booking the same room for two different customers. This happened one time when I was at reception even though I was not responsible for that particular booking. So the customer was very angry at the situation and when they approached reception they wanted to get answers. However, I had to take the responsibility on myself and had to have a very apologetic tone when dealing with the customer and to kind of show them that this was an error with the booking system itself not with the reception. And eventually they understood and we were able to book a new room for them. And one such situation from my time as a support engineer would be when I initially joined the role I did not know the layouts of the entire application or the pitfalls of the application I was working on and I had a really high or tense call with a customer since their transactions were not processed at a specific date. I had to get help from my senior support staff and also convince them of the technical difficulties why they could not do and there was nothing that could be done at the moment and if they allowed us two days of time we would enable the transaction and that this would not happen in the future. And the customer was convinced and they continued to use our software from there on. So these are the two circumstances that come into mind when dealing with customers in a very efficient and responsible and apologetic way to cool them down.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a balanced mix of positive emotions and professional demeanor, with high levels of calmness (0.38), contentment (0.26), and determination (0.30), coupled with strong concentration (0.20) and contemplation (0.24), indicating a thoughtful and composed approach to the interview question, while also displaying satisfaction (0.36) and pride (0.10) in their response, which are generally positive traits in an interview setting.",
        "feedback": "**Accuracy Score: 80%**\n\n**Feedback on Inaccuracies:**\n\n1. **Responsibility and Ownership**: The candidate mentions taking responsibility for a double booking situation, which is a good demonstration of accountability. However, they could have emphasized more on how they communicated with the customer to resolve the issue effectively, showcasing their communication skills in a more detailed manner.\n\n2. **Clarity in Examples**: The candidate provides two examples, but the transition between them is somewhat abrupt. A clearer connection between the examples and the specific skills being demonstrated (communication and interpersonal skills) would enhance the overall clarity and impact of the response.\n\n3. **Specificity of Skills**: While the candidate describes situations where they dealt with agitated customers, they could have explicitly stated the specific communication techniques they used (e.g., active listening, empathy, reassurance) to further illustrate their interpersonal skills.\n\n4. **Relevance of Support Engineer Example**: The second example from their time as a support engineer, while relevant, could be more closely tied to the receptionist role. The candidate should clarify how the skills they used in that situation are applicable to a receptionist position, particularly in terms of customer service and communication.\n\nOverall, the candidate's answer demonstrates relevant experience and skills, but it could be improved by providing more detailed examples and clearer connections to the specific skills required for the receptionist role."

        "interviewer": "Thank you for sharing those examples. One last question: this role requires proficiency with computer systems. Could you briefly describe your experience with various software or systems you've used in your previous roles?",
        "candidate": " I'm sure. I worked as a support engineer in Big Tech for one year. I also worked as a software developer for the last four years of my professional career. So I'm well-honed in programming skills such as Python, Java, using frameworks such as Django and Spring. I'm also well-honed in using Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, and in my current receptionist role, we use a software called Kinetics to book specific rooms and also configure fobs so that the customer has access to their room, hallway, and kitchen, and only their specific room, hallway, and kitchen and not to others. So I would say I'm pretty well-equipped to deal with computer programs.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a high level of contemplation (0.428) and interest (0.308), coupled with notable levels of calmness (0.247), satisfaction (0.230), and realization (0.209), suggesting a thoughtful and engaged approach to the interview question while maintaining a composed and positive demeanor.",
        "feedback": "**Accuracy Score: 85%**\n\n**Feedback on Inaccuracies:**\n\n1. **Relevance of Experience**: The candidate provides a solid overview of their technical skills and experience with software systems. However, they could have elaborated more on how their experience as a receptionist specifically relates to the proficiency required for the role. For instance, detailing any specific tasks or challenges faced while using the Kinetics software would strengthen their response.\n\n2. **Connection to Role Requirements**: While the candidate mentions their programming skills and experience with various software, they do not explicitly connect these skills to the requirements of the receptionist role. It would be beneficial to highlight how their technical background can enhance their performance in a customer-facing position, particularly in terms of problem-solving or using technology to improve customer service.\n\n3. **Detail on Software Usage**: The candidate mentions using Microsoft Word and Excel, but they could provide more context on how they utilized these programs in their previous roles. For example, discussing specific tasks they accomplished with these tools would demonstrate their proficiency more effectively.\n\nOverall, the candidate's answer demonstrates relevant experience and skills, but it could be improved by providing more detailed examples and clearer connections to the specific requirements of the receptionist role."
