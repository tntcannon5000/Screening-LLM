        "interviewer": "Hello! Thank you for taking the time to speak with me today about the Entry-Level Morning Receptionist (Part Time) position at our research institute. I'd like to ask you a few questions to learn more about your qualifications and interest in this role. Could you start by telling me why you're interested in this position?",
        "candidate": " Yes, sure. So I've been working as a part-time receptionist at the University of Kent for a year right now. And I think I'd be qualified in a customer-facing role such as this. Previous to this, I've also worked as a support engineer in big tech companies such as Ingram Micro and TCS, where I had to face customer queries from clients regarding whether the software is working or not. And I'll be graduating the University of Kent in two months, and after that I'm looking for a job in Cambridge, and this happens to be the perfect thing lined up for me.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a high level of confusion (0.295) and boredom (0.150), along with moderate levels of awkwardness (0.080) and calmness (0.098), suggesting they may have struggled to understand or engage with the question while maintaining a composed demeanor, which could be a potential concern in an interview setting.",
        "feedback": "**Accuracy Score: 85%**\n\n**Feedback:**\n\n1. **Relevance of Experience**: The candidate mentions their experience as a part-time receptionist at the University of Kent, which is relevant to the position. However, they could have elaborated more on specific skills or tasks they performed in that role that directly relate to the responsibilities of a morning receptionist at a research institute. This would strengthen their answer.\n\n2. **Transition from Technical Roles**: The candidate discusses their previous experience as a support engineer in tech companies. While this experience demonstrates customer-facing skills, it may not be directly relevant to the receptionist role. They could have focused more on their receptionist experience and how it has prepared them for this specific position rather than detailing their technical background.\n\n3. **Future Aspirations**: The candidate mentions their upcoming graduation and desire to find a job in Cambridge, which shows motivation. However, they could have tied this aspiration more closely to the specific role they are applying for, explaining how this position aligns with their career goals.\n\n4. **Clarity and Structure**: The response could benefit from clearer structure. The candidate jumps between different experiences without a smooth transition, which may make it harder for the interviewer to follow their narrative. A more organized response would enhance clarity.\n\nOverall, while the candidate provides relevant experience, they could improve their answer by focusing more on the specific skills and experiences that directly relate to the receptionist role and presenting their thoughts in a more structured manner."

        "interviewer": "Thank you for sharing that background. It's great to hear about your relevant experience. Could you tell me more about your availability? This position requires opening reception at 8:30 AM and working until 12:45 PM, Monday to Friday. Would you be able to commit to these hours?",
        "candidate": " Yes, sure. After I graduate from university, I will have permission to work 40 hours a week. And apart from that, I am very punctual. Currently, my working hours are from 9 a.m. to 2 a.m. 2 p.m. My bad. And previously, when I worked as a tech support engineer, my working hours were from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Sometimes it extended from 9 a.m. to 10 p.m. depending on heavy workloads. And I was able to deliver to those times. And I think I will be able to deliver for the part-time receptionist role at Cambridge.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited strong determination (0.62) and enthusiasm (0.60), coupled with significant levels of concentration (0.19) and contemplation (0.20), suggesting a focused and engaged approach to the interview question, while also displaying notable excitement (0.30) and interest (0.32) in the topic, indicating a positive and energetic demeanor during this part of the interview.",
        "feedback": "**Accuracy Score: 70%**\n\n**Feedback:**\n\n1. **Availability Commitment**: The candidate does not directly address their ability to commit to the specific hours required for the receptionist position (8:30 AM to 12:45 PM, Monday to Friday). While they mention their working hours and that they will have permission to work 40 hours a week after graduation, they do not confirm whether they can meet the specific schedule of this role. This is a critical aspect of the question that should have been clearly answered.\n\n2. **Current Working Hours**: The candidate states their current working hours as \"from 9 a.m. to 2 a.m. 2 p.m.\" This appears to be a transcription error, and it should be clarified as \"from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m.\" This confusion could lead to misunderstandings about their current availability.\n\n3. **Punctuality and Reliability**: While the candidate mentions being punctual, they could have provided more specific examples or anecdotes that demonstrate their reliability and ability to adhere to a schedule, which would strengthen their response.\n\n4. **Relevance of Experience**: The candidate discusses their previous roles but does not explicitly connect how these experiences prepare them for the specific responsibilities of a receptionist. They could have highlighted skills such as communication, organization, and customer service that are directly relevant to the role.\n\nOverall, the candidate's response lacks a clear commitment to the required hours and does not effectively connect their experiences to the specific role they are applying for."

        "interviewer": "I see, thank you for that information. This role requires excellent communication and interpersonal skills. Can you give me an example of how you've demonstrated these skills in your previous receptionist or customer service roles?",
        "candidate": " I'm sure. I think the most important customer service or speaking skills come into focus when the customer is agitated. So one such example would be double booking the same room for two different customers. This happened one time when I was at reception even though I was not responsible for that particular booking. So the customer was very angry at the situation and when they approached reception they wanted to get answers. However, I had to take the responsibility on myself and had to have a very apologetic tone when dealing with the customer and to kind of show them that this was an error with the booking system itself not with the reception. And eventually they understood and we were able to book a new room for them. And one such situation from my time as a support engineer would be when I initially joined the role I did not know the layouts of the entire application or the pitfalls of the application I was working on and I had a really high or tense call with a customer since their transactions were not processed at a specific date. I had to get help from my senior support staff and also convince them of the technical difficulties why they could not do and there was nothing that could be done at the moment and if they allowed us two days of time we would enable the transaction and that this would not happen in the future. And the customer was convinced and they continued to use our software from there on. So these are the two circumstances that come into mind when dealing with customers in a very efficient and responsible and apologetic way to cool them down.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a notably calm and content demeanor, with high levels of concentration and contemplation, suggesting a thoughtful and composed approach to the interview question, while also displaying significant determination and satisfaction, which are positive indicators for a successful interview performance.",
        "feedback": "**Accuracy Score: 80%**\n\n**Feedback:**\n\n1. **Handling Customer Anger**: The candidate provides a relevant example of dealing with an agitated customer due to a double booking. They demonstrate effective communication and interpersonal skills by taking responsibility and using an apologetic tone. This aligns well with the context provided, which emphasizes the importance of staying calm and showing understanding when dealing with angry customers.\n\n2. **Clarity in Examples**: While the candidate shares two examples, the transition between them could be clearer. The first example about the double booking is well-articulated, but the second example regarding the support engineer role feels somewhat disconnected. A smoother transition or clearer connection between the two examples would enhance the overall coherence of the response.\n\n3. **Specificity of Skills**: The candidate mentions using an apologetic tone and taking responsibility, which are good indicators of their communication skills. However, they could have elaborated on specific techniques or phrases they used to calm the customer, as suggested in the context provided. This would further demonstrate their understanding of effective customer service practices.\n\n4. **Resolution Focus**: The candidate concludes both examples with a positive outcome, which is important. However, they could have emphasized the steps taken to resolve the issues more explicitly, as this aligns with the best practices for handling angry customers mentioned in the context. For instance, detailing how they communicated the resolution process could strengthen their answer.\n\nOverall, the candidate's response effectively showcases their communication and interpersonal skills in challenging situations, but it could benefit from improved clarity and specificity in their examples."

        "interviewer": "Thank you for sharing those examples. One last question: this role requires proficiency with computer systems. Could you briefly describe your experience with various software or systems you've used in your previous roles?",
        "candidate": " I'm sure. I worked as a support engineer in Big Tech for one year. I also worked as a software developer for the last four years of my professional career. So I'm well-honed in programming skills such as Python, Java, using frameworks such as Django and Spring. I'm also well-honed in using Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, and in my current receptionist role, we use a software called Kinetics to book specific rooms and also configure fobs so that the customer has access to their room, hallway, and kitchen, and only their specific room, hallway, and kitchen and not to others. So I would say I'm pretty well-equipped to deal with computer programs.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a high level of contemplation (0.43) and interest (0.31), combined with notable levels of calmness (0.25), satisfaction (0.23), and realization (0.21), suggesting a thoughtful and engaged approach to the interview question with a positive and composed demeanor.",
        "feedback": "**Accuracy Score: 75%**\n\n**Feedback:**\n\n1. **Relevance of Experience**: The candidate provides a solid overview of their experience with various software systems, including programming languages (Python, Java) and frameworks (Django, Spring). However, they could have emphasized more on their experience with software systems specifically related to the receptionist role, such as Kinetics, and how that experience translates to the requirements of the position they are applying for.\n\n2. **Detail on Software Usage**: While the candidate mentions using Microsoft Word and Excel, they do not elaborate on how they utilized these tools in their previous roles. Providing specific examples of tasks or projects where they applied these software skills would strengthen their response.\n\n3. **Connection to Role Requirements**: The candidate states they are \"well-equipped to deal with computer programs,\" but this statement could be more impactful if they provided specific examples of how their skills would benefit the receptionist role. For instance, they could mention how their technical background could help in troubleshooting any software issues that may arise in the reception area.\n\n4. **Clarity and Structure**: The response could benefit from a more organized structure. The candidate jumps between different experiences without a clear transition, which may make it harder for the interviewer to follow their narrative. A more coherent flow would enhance clarity and impact.\n\nOverall, while the candidate demonstrates a range of technical skills, they could improve their answer by focusing more on the specific software systems relevant to the receptionist role and providing clearer examples of their experience."
