        "interviewer": "Hello! Thank you for taking the time to speak with me today about the Entry-Level Morning Receptionist (Part Time) position at our research institute. I'd like to ask you a few questions to learn more about your qualifications and interest in this role. Could you start by telling me why you're interested in this position?",
        "candidate": " Yes, sure. So I've been working as a part-time receptionist at the University of Kent for a year right now. And I think I'd be qualified in a customer-facing role such as this. Previous to this, I've also worked as a support engineer in big tech companies such as Ingram Micro and TCS, where I had to face customer queries from clients regarding whether the software is working or not. And I'll be graduating the University of Kent in two months, and after that I'm looking for a job in Cambridge, and this happens to be the perfect thing lined up for me.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a high level of confusion (0.295) and boredom (0.150), along with moderate levels of calmness (0.098) and awkwardness (0.080), suggesting they may have struggled to understand or engage with the question while maintaining a composed demeanor, which could be concerning in an interview setting.",
        "feedback": "**Accuracy Score: 85%**\n\n**Feedback:**\n\n1. **Experience Relevance**: The candidate mentions working as a part-time receptionist at the University of Kent, which is relevant experience for the Entry-Level Morning Receptionist position. However, they could have elaborated more on specific skills or tasks they performed in that role that directly relate to the responsibilities of the new position, such as handling phone calls, managing appointments, or customer service interactions.\n\n2. **Transition from Tech Support**: The candidate references their previous experience as a support engineer in tech companies. While this experience demonstrates customer service skills, it may not be directly relevant to a receptionist role. They could have focused more on their receptionist experience and how it has prepared them for this specific position rather than detailing their tech support background.\n\n3. **Future Plans**: The candidate mentions graduating in two months and looking for a job in Cambridge, which shows motivation. However, they could strengthen their answer by expressing a specific interest in the research institute's mission or values, which would demonstrate a deeper connection to the role and organization.\n\nOverall, the candidate's answer is strong in terms of relevant experience but could benefit from more specific examples and a clearer connection to the role they are applying for."

        "interviewer": "Thank you for sharing that background. It's great to hear about your relevant experience. Could you tell me more about your availability? This position requires opening reception at 8:30 AM and working until 12:45 PM, Monday to Friday. Would you be able to commit to these hours?",
        "candidate": " Yes, sure. After I graduate from university, I will have permission to work 40 hours a week. And apart from that, I am very punctual. Currently, my working hours are from 9 a.m. to 2 a.m. 2 p.m. My bad. And previously, when I worked as a tech support engineer, my working hours were from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Sometimes it extended from 9 a.m. to 10 p.m. depending on heavy workloads. And I was able to deliver to those times. And I think I will be able to deliver for the part-time receptionist role at Cambridge.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited strong determination (0.62) and enthusiasm (0.60), coupled with high levels of concentration (0.19) and contemplation (0.20), suggesting a focused and passionate approach to the interview question, while also displaying significant interest (0.32) and excitement (0.30) that likely contributed to a positive and engaging interaction.",
        "feedback": "**Accuracy Score: 70%**\n\n**Feedback:**\n\n1. **Availability Clarity**: The candidate mentions that they will have permission to work 40 hours a week after graduation, which is relevant. However, they do not directly address the specific hours required for the receptionist position (8:30 AM to 12:45 PM, Monday to Friday). It would have been more effective if they explicitly confirmed their ability to commit to those specific hours.\n\n2. **Current Working Hours**: The candidate states their current working hours as \"from 9 a.m. to 2 a.m. 2 p.m.\" This appears to be a transcription error, and it should be clarified as \"from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m.\" This confusion could lead to misunderstandings about their current availability.\n\n3. **Punctuality and Commitment**: While the candidate mentions being punctual and able to deliver during their previous roles, they could strengthen their response by providing specific examples of how they managed their time effectively in relation to their work commitments. This would reinforce their reliability for the part-time receptionist role.\n\n4. **Relevance of Previous Experience**: The candidate discusses their experience as a tech support engineer and the flexibility of their working hours. While this demonstrates their ability to handle varying workloads, it may not be directly relevant to the receptionist role. They could have focused more on how their past experiences have prepared them for the specific responsibilities of a receptionist, such as managing front desk operations or customer interactions.\n\nOverall, the candidate's answer provides some relevant information but lacks clarity on their availability for the specific hours required for the position."

        "interviewer": "I see, thank you for that information. This role requires excellent communication and interpersonal skills. Can you give me an example of how you've demonstrated these skills in your previous receptionist or customer service roles?",
        "candidate": " I'm sure. I think the most important customer service or speaking skills come into focus when the customer is agitated. So one such example would be double booking the same room for two different customers. This happened one time when I was at reception even though I was not responsible for that particular booking. So the customer was very angry at the situation and when they approached reception they wanted to get answers. However, I had to take the responsibility on myself and had to have a very apologetic tone when dealing with the customer and to kind of show them that this was an error with the booking system itself not with the reception. And eventually they understood and we were able to book a new room for them. And one such situation from my time as a support engineer would be when I initially joined the role I did not know the layouts of the entire application or the pitfalls of the application I was working on and I had a really high or tense call with a customer since their transactions were not processed at a specific date. I had to get help from my senior support staff and also convince them of the technical difficulties why they could not do and there was nothing that could be done at the moment and if they allowed us two days of time we would enable the transaction and that this would not happen in the future. And the customer was convinced and they continued to use our software from there on. So these are the two circumstances that come into mind when dealing with customers in a very efficient and responsible and apologetic way to cool them down.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a balanced mix of positive emotions and professional demeanor, with notably high levels of calmness (0.38), satisfaction (0.36), determination (0.30), and contentment (0.26), alongside strong indicators of concentration (0.20) and contemplation (0.24), suggesting a composed and thoughtful approach to the interview question that would likely be viewed favorably in a professional setting.",
        "feedback": "**Accuracy Score: 75%**\n\n**Feedback:**\n\n1. **Handling Customer Anger**: The candidate provides a relevant example of dealing with an angry customer due to a double booking. They demonstrate effective communication skills by taking responsibility and using an apologetic tone. However, they could have included more specific phrases or techniques they used to calm the customer, such as acknowledging the customer's feelings or offering a clear resolution, which aligns with best practices for handling angry customers.\n\n2. **Clarity in Examples**: The second example from their time as a support engineer is relevant but could be clearer. The candidate mentions needing help from senior staff, which is fine, but they should emphasize how they communicated with the customer during that tense situation. Highlighting specific phrases or strategies used to convey understanding and empathy would strengthen their response.\n\n3. **Connection to Role**: While the candidate's examples demonstrate their ability to handle difficult situations, they could have made a stronger connection to the specific skills required for the receptionist role. For instance, they could mention how these experiences have prepared them for managing front desk operations or interacting with a diverse range of customers.\n\n4. **Use of Positive Language**: The candidate does not explicitly mention using positive language or reframing the conversation, which is a key aspect of effective customer service. Incorporating this into their examples would align with best practices for dealing with angry customers and demonstrate a deeper understanding of effective communication strategies.\n\nOverall, the candidate's answer is relevant and provides good examples, but it could benefit from more specific details and a stronger connection to the skills required for the receptionist position."

        "interviewer": "Thank you for sharing those examples. One last question: this role requires proficiency with computer systems. Could you briefly describe your experience with various software or systems you've used in your previous roles?",
        "candidate": " I'm sure. I worked as a support engineer in Big Tech for one year. I also worked as a software developer for the last four years of my professional career. So I'm well-honed in programming skills such as Python, Java, using frameworks such as Django and Spring. I'm also well-honed in using Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, and in my current receptionist role, we use a software called Kinetics to book specific rooms and also configure fobs so that the customer has access to their room, hallway, and kitchen, and only their specific room, hallway, and kitchen and not to others. So I would say I'm pretty well-equipped to deal with computer programs.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a high level of contemplation (0.428) and interest (0.308), combined with notable levels of calmness (0.247), satisfaction (0.230), and realization (0.209), suggesting a thoughtful and engaged approach to the interview question while maintaining a composed and positive demeanor.",
        "feedback": "**Accuracy Score: 80%**\n\n**Feedback:**\n\n1. **Experience with Software**: The candidate mentions their experience as a support engineer and software developer, which is relevant to the question about proficiency with computer systems. However, they could have provided more specific examples of software or systems they used in those roles, particularly in relation to their work as a receptionist. For instance, they could have mentioned any customer relationship management (CRM) systems or scheduling software they used in their previous roles.\n\n2. **Specificity in Software Usage**: While the candidate lists programming languages and frameworks, they do not elaborate on how these skills translate to the receptionist role. It would have been beneficial to connect their technical skills to the requirements of the receptionist position, such as using software for scheduling, communication, or customer management.\n\n3. **Current Role Software**: The candidate mentions using Kinetics software in their current receptionist role, which is a good example. However, they could have elaborated on their proficiency with this software, such as specific tasks they perform or challenges they have overcome while using it. This would provide a clearer picture of their capabilities.\n\n4. **General Proficiency Statement**: The candidate concludes by stating they are \"pretty well-equipped to deal with computer programs.\" This statement is somewhat vague. They could strengthen their answer by providing specific examples of how they have successfully navigated challenges with software or systems in their previous roles, demonstrating their adaptability and problem-solving skills.\n\nOverall, the candidate's answer is relevant and provides a good overview of their experience, but it could benefit from more specific examples and a clearer connection to the skills required for the receptionist position."
