        "interviewer": "Hello! Thank you for taking the time to speak with me today about the Entry-Level Morning Receptionist (Part Time) position at our research institute. I'd like to ask you a few questions to learn more about your qualifications and interest in this role. Could you start by telling me why you're interested in this position?",
        "candidate": " Yes, sure. So I've been working as a part-time receptionist at the University of Kent for a year right now. And I think I'd be qualified in a customer-facing role such as this. Previous to this, I've also worked as a support engineer in big tech companies such as Ingram Micro and TCS, where I had to face customer queries from clients regarding whether the software is working or not. And I'll be graduating the University of Kent in two months, and after that I'm looking for a job in Cambridge, and this happens to be the perfect thing lined up for me.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a notable level of calmness (0.319) and interest (0.223), along with moderate levels of positive surprise (0.160) and enthusiasm (0.094), indicating an engaged and composed demeanor, although a slight undercurrent of boredom (0.109) was also present, which could potentially be a point of concern in an interview setting.",
        "feedback": "**Accuracy Score: 85%**\n\n**Feedback:**\n\n1. The candidate mentions they have been working as a part-time receptionist for a year at the University of Kent, which is relevant experience for the role. However, they could have elaborated more on specific skills or experiences that directly relate to the responsibilities of a receptionist, such as handling phone calls, managing appointments, or dealing with customer inquiries.\n\n2. The candidate references their previous experience as a support engineer in tech companies, which demonstrates customer service skills. However, they could have connected this experience more explicitly to the skills required for a receptionist role, such as communication and organizational skills.\n\n3. The candidate states they will be graduating in two months and are looking for a job in Cambridge, which shows their motivation and readiness for employment. However, they could have emphasized their interest in the specific research institute and how it aligns with their career goals, which would strengthen their response.\n\nOverall, while the candidate provides relevant experience and motivation, they could enhance their answer by making clearer connections between their past roles and the specific skills needed for the receptionist position."

        "interviewer": "Thank you for sharing that background. It's great to hear about your relevant experience. Could you tell me more about your availability? This position requires opening reception at 8:30 AM and working until 12:45 PM, Monday to Friday. Would you be able to commit to these hours?",
        "candidate": " Yes, sure. After I graduate from university, I will have permission to work 40 hours a week. And apart from that, I am very punctual. Currently, my working hours are from 9 a.m. to 2 a.m. 2 p.m. My bad. And previously, when I worked as a tech support engineer, my working hours were from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Sometimes it extended from 9 a.m. to 10 p.m. depending on heavy workloads. And I was able to deliver to those times. And I think I will be able to deliver for the part-time receptionist role at Cambridge.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited strong determination (0.62) and enthusiasm (0.60), coupled with a high level of concentration (0.19) and interest (0.32), suggesting they were engaged and motivated during the interview, while also displaying a positive emotional state as indicated by the sentiment scores leaning towards the higher end of the scale (7-9).",
        "feedback": "**Accuracy Score: 70%**\n\n**Feedback:**\n\n1. The candidate states they will have permission to work 40 hours a week after graduation, which is accurate. However, they do not directly address their availability for the specific hours required for the receptionist position (8:30 AM to 12:45 PM, Monday to Friday). This is a critical aspect of the question that should have been explicitly confirmed.\n\n2. The candidate mentions their current working hours as \"from 9 a.m. to 2 a.m. 2 p.m.\" This appears to be a transcription error, as it should likely read \"from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m.\" This could lead to confusion regarding their current schedule.\n\n3. While the candidate emphasizes their punctuality and previous work experience, they do not provide a clear commitment to the specific hours required for the receptionist role. They should have explicitly stated their ability to work the required hours instead of implying it.\n\n4. The candidate discusses their previous experience as a tech support engineer, which is relevant but does not directly relate to the receptionist role. They could have focused more on skills that are directly applicable to the receptionist position, such as managing front desk operations, handling phone calls, or scheduling appointments.\n\nOverall, the candidate's response lacks a direct confirmation of their availability for the specific hours required for the position, which is essential for the interviewer to know."

        "interviewer": "I see, thank you for that information. This role requires excellent communication and interpersonal skills. Can you give me an example of how you've demonstrated these skills in your previous receptionist or customer service roles?",
        "candidate": " I'm sure. I think the most important customer service or speaking skills come into focus when the customer is agitated. So one such example would be double booking the same room for two different customers. This happened one time when I was at reception even though I was not responsible for that particular booking. So the customer was very angry at the situation and when they approached reception they wanted to get answers. However, I had to take the responsibility on myself and had to have a very apologetic tone when dealing with the customer and to kind of show them that this was an error with the booking system itself not with the reception. And eventually they understood and we were able to book a new room for them. And one such situation from my time as a support engineer would be when I initially joined the role I did not know the layouts of the entire application or the pitfalls of the application I was working on and I had a really high or tense call with a customer since their transactions were not processed at a specific date. I had to get help from my senior support staff and also convince them of the technical difficulties why they could not do and there was nothing that could be done at the moment and if they allowed us two days of time we would enable the transaction and that this would not happen in the future. And the customer was convinced and they continued to use our software from there on. So these are the two circumstances that come into mind when dealing with customers in a very efficient and responsible and apologetic way to cool them down.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a balanced mix of positive emotions, with notably high levels of calmness (0.38), satisfaction (0.36), and contentment (0.26), alongside strong indicators of determination (0.30) and concentration (0.20), suggesting a composed and focused demeanor that would be highly suitable for a successful interview.",
        "feedback": "**Accuracy Score: 75%**\n\n**Feedback:**\n\n1. The candidate provides a relevant example of handling an agitated customer due to a double booking situation. They demonstrate effective communication skills by taking responsibility, using an apologetic tone, and ultimately resolving the issue. This aligns well with the requirement for excellent communication and interpersonal skills.\n\n2. The second example from their time as a support engineer also illustrates their ability to handle a tense situation. They mention seeking help from senior staff and explaining the technical difficulties to the customer, which shows their willingness to collaborate and communicate effectively under pressure.\n\n3. However, the candidate could have improved their response by explicitly stating how they used specific communication techniques, such as active listening or empathy, to de-escalate the situations. Incorporating phrases from the provided context, such as \"I completely understand the frustration you\u2019re feeling,\" could have strengthened their examples.\n\n4. The candidate's answer is somewhat lengthy and could benefit from being more concise. While they provide two examples, they could have focused on one strong example that clearly highlights their skills, making it easier for the interviewer to follow.\n\n5. The candidate does not mention any specific outcomes or feedback from the customers after resolving the issues, which could have added more weight to their examples. Including how the customers reacted positively after the resolution would demonstrate the effectiveness of their communication skills.\n\nOverall, while the candidate provides relevant examples and demonstrates their ability to handle difficult situations, they could enhance their answer by being more concise, incorporating specific communication techniques, and highlighting positive outcomes from their interactions."

        "interviewer": "Thank you for sharing those examples. One last question: this role requires proficiency with computer systems. Could you briefly describe your experience with various software or systems you've used in your previous roles?",
        "candidate": " I'm sure. I worked as a support engineer in Big Tech for one year. I also worked as a software developer for the last four years of my professional career. So I'm well-honed in programming skills such as Python, Java, using frameworks such as Django and Spring. I'm also well-honed in using Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, and in my current receptionist role, we use a software called Kinetics to book specific rooms and also configure fobs so that the customer has access to their room, hallway, and kitchen, and only their specific room, hallway, and kitchen and not to others. So I would say I'm pretty well-equipped to deal with computer programs.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a high level of contemplation (0.428) and interest (0.308), combined with notable levels of calmness (0.247), satisfaction (0.230), and realization (0.209), suggesting a thoughtful and engaged approach to the interview question while maintaining a composed and positive demeanor.",
        "feedback": "**Accuracy Score: 80%**\n\n**Feedback:**\n\n1. The candidate provides a solid overview of their experience with various software and systems, including programming languages (Python, Java) and frameworks (Django, Spring). This demonstrates their technical proficiency, which is relevant to the role.\n\n2. They mention their experience with Microsoft Word and Excel, which are common software tools, but they could have elaborated on how they used these tools in a professional context, such as creating reports or managing data.\n\n3. The candidate discusses their current role as a receptionist and the use of Kinetics software for booking rooms and configuring access. This is a relevant example that shows their ability to work with specific software systems, which aligns well with the job requirements.\n\n4. However, the candidate could have improved their answer by providing more detail on their experience with the software systems mentioned. For instance, they could have described specific tasks they performed using Kinetics or how they utilized their programming skills in a practical setting.\n\n5. The phrase \"I'm well-honed\" is somewhat informal and could be replaced with a more professional expression, such as \"I have developed strong skills\" or \"I am proficient in.\" This would enhance the overall professionalism of the response.\n\nOverall, the candidate demonstrates relevant experience and skills but could strengthen their answer by providing more specific examples of how they have used the software and systems in their previous roles."
