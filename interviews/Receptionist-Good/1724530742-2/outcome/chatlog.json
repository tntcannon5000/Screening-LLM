        "interviewer": "Hello! Thank you for taking the time to speak with me today about the Entry-Level Morning Receptionist (Part Time) position at our research institute. I'd like to ask you a few questions to learn more about your qualifications and interest in this role. Could you start by telling me why you're interested in this position?",
        "candidate": " Yes, sure. So I've been working as a part-time receptionist at the University of Kent for a year right now. And I think I'd be qualified in a customer-facing role such as this. Previous to this, I've also worked as a support engineer in big tech companies such as Ingram Micro and TCS, where I had to face customer queries from clients regarding whether the software is working or not. And I'll be graduating the University of Kent in two months, and after that I'm looking for a job in Cambridge, and this happens to be the perfect thing lined up for me.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a notable level of calmness (0.22) and interest (0.17), along with moderate levels of enthusiasm (0.11) and positive surprise (0.17), indicating an engaged and composed demeanor during the interview, while also displaying some signs of awkwardness (0.09) and confusion (0.06), which could potentially be areas for improvement in future professional interactions.",
        "feedback": "The accuracy score for the answer provided is 85%.\n\nFeedback on inaccuracies:\n\n1. **Relevance of Experience**: While the candidate mentions their experience as a part-time receptionist, they could have elaborated more on specific skills or tasks that directly relate to the responsibilities of the Entry-Level Morning Receptionist position. For example, discussing their ability to manage phone calls, greet visitors, or handle scheduling would strengthen their response.\n\n2. **Connection to the Role**: The candidate states that the position is \"the perfect thing lined up for me,\" but does not clearly articulate why this specific role at the research institute aligns with their career goals or interests. Providing more insight into their motivation for working at this particular institute would enhance their answer.\n\n3. **Future Aspirations**: The mention of looking for a job in Cambridge is relevant, but it could be more impactful if the candidate connected this aspiration to the role they are applying for. They could express how this position fits into their long-term career plans or how they see themselves contributing to the institute.\n\nOverall, the candidate has relevant experience, but providing more specific details and connections to the role would improve the response."

        "interviewer": "Thank you for sharing that background. It's great to hear about your relevant experience. Could you tell me more about your availability? This position requires opening reception at 8:30 AM and working until 12:45 PM, Monday to Friday. Would you be able to commit to these hours?",
        "candidate": " Yes, sure. After I graduate from university, I will have permission to work 40 hours a week. And apart from that, I am very punctual. Currently, my working hours are from 9 a.m. to 2 a.m. 2 p.m. My bad. And previously, when I worked as a tech support engineer, my working hours were from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Sometimes it extended from 9 a.m. to 10 p.m. depending on heavy workloads. And I was able to deliver to those times. And I think I will be able to deliver for the part-time receptionist role at Cambridge.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited strong determination (0.62) and enthusiasm (0.60), coupled with high levels of concentration (0.19) and contemplation (0.20), suggesting a focused and passionate approach to the interview question, while also demonstrating significant interest (0.32) and excitement (0.30) in the topic, which are all positive indicators for a successful interview performance.",
        "feedback": "The accuracy score for the answer provided is 75%.\n\nFeedback on inaccuracies:\n\n1. **Availability Clarity**: The candidate mentions that they will have permission to work 40 hours a week after graduation, but they do not directly address the specific hours required for the receptionist position (8:30 AM to 12:45 PM, Monday to Friday). It would be beneficial for the candidate to explicitly confirm their ability to commit to these specific hours.\n\n2. **Current Working Hours Confusion**: The candidate states their current working hours as \"from 9 a.m. to 2 a.m. 2 p.m.\" This appears to be a transcription error, and it should be clarified as \"from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m.\" This confusion could lead to misunderstandings about their current availability.\n\n3. **Relevance of Previous Experience**: While the candidate mentions their previous experience as a tech support engineer, they do not connect this experience to the skills needed for the receptionist role. They could enhance their response by discussing how their past roles have prepared them for customer interaction and multitasking in a reception environment.\n\nOverall, the candidate's response lacks clarity regarding their availability for the specific hours required and could benefit from a stronger connection between their past experiences and the responsibilities of the receptionist role."

        "interviewer": "I see, thank you for that information. This role requires excellent communication and interpersonal skills. Can you give me an example of how you've demonstrated these skills in your previous receptionist or customer service roles?",
        "candidate": " I'm sure. I think the most important customer service or speaking skills come into focus when the customer is agitated. So one such example would be double booking the same room for two different customers. This happened one time when I was at reception even though I was not responsible for that particular booking. So the customer was very angry at the situation and when they approached reception they wanted to get answers. However, I had to take the responsibility on myself and had to have a very apologetic tone when dealing with the customer and to kind of show them that this was an error with the booking system itself not with the reception. And eventually they understood and we were able to book a new room for them. And one such situation from my time as a support engineer would be when I initially joined the role I did not know the layouts of the entire application or the pitfalls of the application I was working on and I had a really high or tense call with a customer since their transactions were not processed at a specific date. I had to get help from my senior support staff and also convince them of the technical difficulties why they could not do and there was nothing that could be done at the moment and if they allowed us two days of time we would enable the transaction and that this would not happen in the future. And the customer was convinced and they continued to use our software from there on. So these are the two circumstances that come into mind when dealing with customers in a very efficient and responsible and apologetic way to cool them down.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a balanced and positive emotional state, characterized by high levels of calmness (0.38), satisfaction (0.36), and contentment (0.26), coupled with strong determination (0.30) and concentration (0.20), suggesting a composed and focused demeanor that would be highly suitable for a successful interview.",
        "feedback": "**Accuracy Score: 80%**\n\n**Feedback on Inaccuracies:**\n\n1. **Clarity of Examples**: The candidate provides two examples of handling customer service situations, but the first example about double booking could be clearer. While they mention taking responsibility and using an apologetic tone, they could elaborate on specific communication techniques they used to de-escalate the situation. This would strengthen the demonstration of their communication skills.\n\n2. **Connection to Role**: The candidate mentions their experience as a support engineer but does not explicitly connect this experience to the receptionist role. They could enhance their response by discussing how the skills they developed in that role, such as problem-solving and customer interaction, are relevant to the responsibilities of a receptionist.\n\n3. **Length and Focus**: The response is somewhat lengthy and could benefit from being more concise. The candidate could focus on one or two key examples that best illustrate their communication and interpersonal skills, rather than providing two separate instances that may dilute the impact of their answer.\n\nOverall, while the candidate provides relevant examples, enhancing clarity, making stronger connections to the role, and being more concise would improve the effectiveness of their response."

        "interviewer": "Thank you for sharing those examples. One last question: this role requires proficiency with computer systems. Could you briefly describe your experience with various software or systems you've used in your previous roles?",
        "candidate": " I'm sure. I worked as a support engineer in Big Tech for one year. I also worked as a software developer for the last four years of my professional career. So I'm well-honed in programming skills such as Python, Java, using frameworks such as Django and Spring. I'm also well-honed in using Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, and in my current receptionist role, we use a software called Kinetics to book specific rooms and also configure fobs so that the customer has access to their room, hallway, and kitchen, and only their specific room, hallway, and kitchen and not to others. So I would say I'm pretty well-equipped to deal with computer programs.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a high level of contemplation (0.428) and interest (0.308), coupled with a sense of calmness (0.247) and satisfaction (0.230), suggesting they were thoughtfully engaged with the question while maintaining a composed and positive demeanor suitable for a professional interview setting.",
        "feedback": "**Accuracy Score: 85%**\n\n**Feedback on Inaccuracies:**\n\n1. **Relevance of Experience**: The candidate mentions their experience as a support engineer and software developer, which is relevant, but they could have provided more specific examples of software systems they have used in those roles. For instance, mentioning any specific tools or applications they worked with in their software development role would strengthen their response.\n\n2. **Detail on Software Proficiency**: While the candidate lists programming languages and frameworks, they do not elaborate on how these skills translate to the proficiency required for the receptionist role. It would be beneficial to connect their technical skills to the software systems they would be using in the receptionist position, such as Kinetics, to demonstrate a broader understanding of computer systems.\n\n3. **Clarity on Current Role**: The candidate mentions using Kinetics in their current receptionist role but could provide more detail about their specific responsibilities with that software. For example, explaining how they manage bookings or handle customer access through the software would give a clearer picture of their proficiency.\n\nOverall, while the candidate demonstrates a solid background in technology and software, providing more specific examples and connections to the role would enhance the effectiveness of their response."
