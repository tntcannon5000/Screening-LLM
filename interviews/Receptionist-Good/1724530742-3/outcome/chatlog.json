        "interviewer": "Hello! Thank you for taking the time to speak with me today about the Entry-Level Morning Receptionist (Part Time) position at our research institute. I'd like to ask you a few questions to learn more about your qualifications and interest in this role. Could you start by telling me why you're interested in this position?",
        "candidate": " Yes, sure. So I've been working as a part-time receptionist at the University of Kent for a year right now. And I think I'd be qualified in a customer-facing role such as this. Previous to this, I've also worked as a support engineer in big tech companies such as Ingram Micro and TCS, where I had to face customer queries from clients regarding whether the software is working or not. And I'll be graduating the University of Kent in two months, and after that I'm looking for a job in Cambridge, and this happens to be the perfect thing lined up for me.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a high level of confusion (0.295) and boredom (0.150), coupled with moderate levels of awkwardness (0.080) and calmness (0.098), suggesting they may have struggled to understand or engage with the question while maintaining a somewhat composed demeanor, which could be concerning in an interview setting.",
        "feedback": "The accuracy score for the answer provided is 85%.\n\nFeedback on inaccuracies:\n\n1. **Relevance of Experience**: While the candidate mentions their experience as a part-time receptionist at the University of Kent, they could have elaborated more on how this specific experience directly relates to the responsibilities of the Entry-Level Morning Receptionist position at the research institute. Providing specific examples of tasks or skills gained in that role would strengthen their response.\n\n2. **Connection to the Role**: The candidate states that the position is \"the perfect thing lined up for me,\" but does not clearly articulate what specific aspects of the role or the research institute appeal to them. A more detailed explanation of their interest in the research institute or how their skills align with the job requirements would enhance their answer.\n\n3. **Future Aspirations**: The candidate mentions looking for a job in Cambridge after graduation, which is relevant, but they could have tied this back to their interest in the position more explicitly. For example, discussing how this role fits into their career goals or how they see themselves contributing to the institute would provide a stronger connection.\n\nOverall, while the candidate has relevant experience, enhancing the specificity and connection to the role would improve the response."

        "interviewer": "Thank you for sharing that background. It's great to hear about your relevant experience. Could you tell me more about your availability? This position requires opening reception at 8:30 AM and working until 12:45 PM, Monday to Friday. Would you be able to commit to these hours?",
        "candidate": " Yes, sure. After I graduate from university, I will have permission to work 40 hours a week. And apart from that, I am very punctual. Currently, my working hours are from 9 a.m. to 2 a.m. 2 p.m. My bad. And previously, when I worked as a tech support engineer, my working hours were from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Sometimes it extended from 9 a.m. to 10 p.m. depending on heavy workloads. And I was able to deliver to those times. And I think I will be able to deliver for the part-time receptionist role at Cambridge.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited strong determination (0.62) and enthusiasm (0.60), coupled with a high level of concentration (0.19) and interest (0.32), suggesting they were highly engaged and motivated during the interview, while also displaying a positive emotional state as indicated by the sentiment scores leaning towards the higher end of the scale (7-9).",
        "feedback": "The accuracy score for the answer provided is 75%.\n\nFeedback on inaccuracies:\n\n1. **Availability Commitment**: The candidate does not explicitly confirm their ability to commit to the required hours of 8:30 AM to 12:45 PM, Monday to Friday. While they mention having permission to work 40 hours a week after graduation, they should directly address the specific hours required for this position to provide clarity.\n\n2. **Current Working Hours**: The candidate states their current working hours as \"from 9 a.m. to 2 a.m. 2 p.m.\" which appears to be a transcription error. They likely meant to say \"from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m.\" This could lead to confusion regarding their current availability.\n\n3. **Relevance of Experience**: While the candidate mentions their punctuality and previous work experience, they could have more directly linked their past roles to the responsibilities of the receptionist position. For example, discussing specific skills or experiences that would help them succeed in this role would strengthen their response.\n\n4. **Clarity and Conciseness**: The answer could be more concise. The candidate provides a lot of information about their previous roles, but it may detract from the main point of addressing their availability for the receptionist position. A more focused response would improve clarity."

        "interviewer": "I see, thank you for that information. This role requires excellent communication and interpersonal skills. Can you give me an example of how you've demonstrated these skills in your previous receptionist or customer service roles?",
        "candidate": " I'm sure. I think the most important customer service or speaking skills come into focus when the customer is agitated. So one such example would be double booking the same room for two different customers. This happened one time when I was at reception even though I was not responsible for that particular booking. So the customer was very angry at the situation and when they approached reception they wanted to get answers. However, I had to take the responsibility on myself and had to have a very apologetic tone when dealing with the customer and to kind of show them that this was an error with the booking system itself not with the reception. And eventually they understood and we were able to book a new room for them. And one such situation from my time as a support engineer would be when I initially joined the role I did not know the layouts of the entire application or the pitfalls of the application I was working on and I had a really high or tense call with a customer since their transactions were not processed at a specific date. I had to get help from my senior support staff and also convince them of the technical difficulties why they could not do and there was nothing that could be done at the moment and if they allowed us two days of time we would enable the transaction and that this would not happen in the future. And the customer was convinced and they continued to use our software from there on. So these are the two circumstances that come into mind when dealing with customers in a very efficient and responsible and apologetic way to cool them down.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a notably calm and content demeanor, with high levels of concentration and contemplation, suggesting a thoughtful and composed approach to the interview question, while also displaying significant determination and satisfaction, which are positive indicators for a successful interview performance.",
        "feedback": "**Accuracy Score: 80%**\n\n**Feedback on Inaccuracies:**\n\n1. **Clarity of Examples**: The candidate provides two examples of handling customer service situations, but the first example about double booking could be clearer. They mention that they were not responsible for the booking, which may lead to confusion about their role in resolving the issue. It would be beneficial to emphasize their proactive approach in taking responsibility and how they effectively communicated with the customer to resolve the situation.\n\n2. **Connection to Communication Skills**: While the candidate discusses their experiences, they could have more explicitly linked these examples to the specific communication and interpersonal skills required for the receptionist role. For instance, they could highlight how their apologetic tone and ability to convey technical information helped de-escalate the situations.\n\n3. **Length and Conciseness**: The response is somewhat lengthy and could be more concise. The candidate could focus on the most relevant aspects of each example to maintain the interviewer's attention and ensure that the key points about their communication skills are clear.\n\n4. **Technical Jargon**: In the second example, the candidate uses terms like \"technical difficulties\" and \"transaction processing,\" which may not be easily understood by all interviewers. Simplifying this language or providing a brief explanation could enhance clarity and ensure that the interviewer fully grasps the situation they are describing."

        "interviewer": "Thank you for sharing those examples. One last question: this role requires proficiency with computer systems. Could you briefly describe your experience with various software or systems you've used in your previous roles?",
        "candidate": " I'm sure. I worked as a support engineer in Big Tech for one year. I also worked as a software developer for the last four years of my professional career. So I'm well-honed in programming skills such as Python, Java, using frameworks such as Django and Spring. I'm also well-honed in using Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, and in my current receptionist role, we use a software called Kinetics to book specific rooms and also configure fobs so that the customer has access to their room, hallway, and kitchen, and only their specific room, hallway, and kitchen and not to others. So I would say I'm pretty well-equipped to deal with computer programs.",
        "sentiment": "For this particular response, the candidate exhibited a high level of contemplation (0.43) and interest (0.31), coupled with a sense of calmness (0.25) and satisfaction (0.23), suggesting they were thoughtfully engaged with the question while maintaining a composed and positive demeanor, which are generally favorable traits in an interview setting.",
        "feedback": "**Accuracy Score: 85%**\n\n**Feedback on Inaccuracies:**\n\n1. **Relevance of Experience**: While the candidate mentions their experience as a support engineer and software developer, they could have provided more specific examples of how these roles required proficiency with computer systems. For instance, detailing any particular software or systems they used in those roles would strengthen their response.\n\n2. **Clarity of Software Usage**: The candidate states they are \"well-honed\" in using Microsoft Word and Excel, but they could elaborate on how they utilized these programs in a professional context. Providing specific tasks or projects where they applied these skills would enhance the clarity of their experience.\n\n3. **Current Role Context**: The mention of using Kinetics in their current receptionist role is relevant, but the candidate could have briefly explained what Kinetics is and how it functions in their daily tasks. This would provide a clearer picture of their experience with computer systems.\n\n4. **Overall Structure**: The response could be more concise. The candidate provides a lot of information about their programming skills, but it may detract from the main point of addressing their experience with various software or systems. A more focused response would improve clarity and impact."
