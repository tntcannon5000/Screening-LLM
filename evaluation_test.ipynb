However, I had take the responsibility on myself and had to have a reap tone when dealing with the customer and to kinda show them that this was an error with the booking system itself, not with the reception. And, eventually, they understood and we were able to book a new room for them, And one such situation from my time has a, support engineer would be when I initially joined the role, I did not know that layouts of the entire application of the pitfalls of the application I was working on, and I had of really, high your tense call with a customer, since their transactions were not processed at a specific date. I had to get help for my senior support stuff and also convince them of the technical difficulties why they could not do, and there was nothing that could be done at the moment and if they allowed us two days of time, we would, enable the transaction and that this will not... This would not happen in the future. And the customer was convinced and they continue to use our software from their own. So these are the two circumstances that that come into mind and dealing with customers in a very efficient and responsible and ap way to cool them down.', 'position': {'begin': 0, 'end': 1600}, 'time': {'begin': 0.99677414, 'end': 115.201935}, 'confidence': None, 'speaker_confidence': None, 'emotions': [{'name': 'Admiration', 'score': 0.08817142993211746}, {'name': 'Adoration', 'score': 0.008533072657883167}, {'name': 'Aesthetic Appreciation', 'score': 0.0352221317589283}, {'name': 'Amusement', 'score': 0.005020504351705313}, {'name': 'Anger', 'score': 0.0020057284273207188}, {'name': 'Annoyance', 'score': 0.015308661386370659}, {'name': 'Anxiety', 'score': 0.001693394617177546}, {'name': 'Awe', 'score': 0.024090196937322617}, {'name': 'Awkwardness', 'score': 0.0028606003616005182}, {'name': 'Boredom', 'score': 0.008181986398994923}, {'name': 'Calmness', 'score': 0.2470187395811081}, {'name': 'Concentration', 'score': 0.12647004425525665}, {'name': 'Confusion', 'score': 0.027573926374316216}, {'name': 'Contemplation', 'score': 0.4279176890850067}, {'name': 'Contempt', 'score': 0.04656289890408516}, {'name': 'Contentment', 'score': 0.11688139289617538}, {'name': 'Craving', 'score': 0.0017727792728692293}, {'name': 'Desire', 'score': 0.000757724919822067}, {'name': 'Determination', 'score': 0.03976697102189064}, {'name': 'Disappointment', 'score': 0.0076288157142698765}, {'name': 'Disapproval', 'score': 0.01666758395731449}, {'name': 'Disgust', 'score': 0.0027863511350005865}, {'name': 'Distress', 'score': 0.0014113171491771936}, {'name': 'Doubt', 'score': 0.012465143576264381}, {'name': 'Ecstasy', 'score': 0.001145100686699152}, {'name': 'Embarrassment', 'score': 0.00035980806569568813}, {'name': 'Empathic Pain', 'score': 0.004546783864498138}, {'name': 'Enthusiasm', 'score': 0.048065003007650375}, {'name': 'Entrancement', 'score': 0.01855817437171936}, {'name': 'Envy', 'score': 0.0031436877325177193}, {'name': 'Excitement', 'score': 0.009410819970071316}, {'name': 'Fear', 'score': 0.0006520568276755512}, {'name': 'Gratitude', 'score': 0.037922099232673645}, {'name': 'Guilt', 'score': 0.00023694071569480002}, {'name': 'Horror', 'score': 0.0002850347082130611}, {'name': 'Interest', 'score': 0.3084111511707306}, {'name': 'Joy', 'score': 0.005850089713931084}, {'name': 'Love', 'score': 0.0017337946919724345}, {'name': 'Nostalgia', 'score': 0.008374562487006187}, {'name': 'Pain', 'score': 0.0005836741765961051}, {'name': 'Pride', 'score': 0.019035806879401207}, {'name': 'Realization', 'score': 0.20919150114059448}, {'name': 'Relief', 'score': 0.03439120948314667}, {'name': 'Romance', 'score': 0.0006632751901634037}, {'name': 'Sadness', 'score': 0.0014278190210461617}, {'name': 'Sarcasm', 'score': 0.011929919011890888}, {'name': 'Satisfaction', 'score': 0.22987842559814453}, {'name': 'Shame', 'score': 0.0008615041733719409}, {'name': 'Surprise (negative)', 'score': 0.008857762441039085}, {'name': 'Surprise (positive)', 'score': 0.04133295640349388}, {'name': 'Sympathy', 'score': 0.007729904260486364}, {'name': 'Tiredness', 'score': 0.0018989023519679904}, {'name': 'Triumph', 'score': 0.03762553259730339}], 'sentiment': [{'name': '1', 'score': 0.01932510919868946}, {'name': '2', 'score': 0.09415555745363235}, {'name': '3', 'score': 0.11722620576620102}, {'name': '4', 'score': 0.15553434193134308}, {'name': '5', 'score': 0.27580779790878296}, {'name': '6', 'score': 0.10464252531528473}, {'name': '7', 'score': 0.12186112999916077}, {'name': '8', 'score': 0.06550054252147675}, {'name': '9', 'score': 0.020424112677574158}], 'toxicity': [{'name': 'identity_hate', 'score': 0.0030525631736963987}, {'name': 'insult', 'score': 0.0019690701737999916}, {'name': 'obscene', 'score': 0.0018790934700518847}, {'name': 'severe_toxic', 'score': 0.0022197244688868523}, {'name': 'threat', 'score': 0.0030061714351177216}, {'name': 'toxic', 'score': 0.006297819782048464}]}]}]}}}], 'errors': []}}]\n",

However, I had take the responsibility on myself and had to have a reap tone when dealing with the customer and to kinda show them that this was an error with the booking system itself, not with the reception. And, eventually, they understood and we were able to book a new room for them, And one such situation from my time has a, support engineer would be when I initially joined the role, I did not know that layouts of the entire application of the pitfalls of the application I was working on, and I had of really, high your tense call with a customer, since their transactions were not processed at a specific date. I had to get help for my senior support stuff and also convince them of the technical difficulties why they could not do, and there was nothing that could be done at the moment and if they allowed us two days of time, we would, enable the transaction and that this will not... This would not happen in the future. And the customer was convinced and they continue to use our software from their own. So these are the two circumstances that that come into mind and dealing with customers in a very efficient and responsible and ap way to cool them down.', 'position': {'begin': 0, 'end': 1606}, 'time': {'begin': 0.99677414, 'end': 115.201935}, 'confidence': None, 'speaker_confidence': None, 'emotions': [{'name': 'Admiration', 'score': 0.08817142993211746}, {'name': 'Adoration', 'score': 0.008533072657883167}, {'name': 'Aesthetic Appreciation', 'score': 0.0352221317589283}, {'name': 'Amusement', 'score': 0.005020504351705313}, {'name': 'Anger', 'score': 0.0020057284273207188}, {'name': 'Annoyance', 'score': 0.015308661386370659}, {'name': 'Anxiety', 'score': 0.001693394617177546}, {'name': 'Awe', 'score': 0.024090196937322617}, {'name': 'Awkwardness', 'score': 0.0028606003616005182}, {'name': 'Boredom', 'score': 0.008181986398994923}, {'name': 'Calmness', 'score': 0.2470187395811081}, {'name': 'Concentration', 'score': 0.12647004425525665}, {'name': 'Confusion', 'score': 0.027573926374316216}, {'name': 'Contemplation', 'score': 0.4279176890850067}, {'name': 'Contempt', 'score': 0.04656289890408516}, {'name': 'Contentment', 'score': 0.11688139289617538}, {'name': 'Craving', 'score': 0.0017727792728692293}, {'name': 'Desire', 'score': 0.000757724919822067}, {'name': 'Determination', 'score': 0.03976697102189064}, {'name': 'Disappointment', 'score': 0.0076288157142698765}, {'name': 'Disapproval', 'score': 0.01666758395731449}, {'name': 'Disgust', 'score': 0.0027863511350005865}, {'name': 'Distress', 'score': 0.0014113171491771936}, {'name': 'Doubt', 'score': 0.012465143576264381}, {'name': 'Ecstasy', 'score': 0.001145100686699152}, {'name': 'Embarrassment', 'score': 0.00035980806569568813}, {'name': 'Empathic Pain', 'score': 0.004546783864498138}, {'name': 'Enthusiasm', 'score': 0.048065003007650375}, {'name': 'Entrancement', 'score': 0.01855817437171936}, {'name': 'Envy', 'score': 0.0031436877325177193}, {'name': 'Excitement', 'score': 0.009410819970071316}, {'name': 'Fear', 'score': 0.0006520568276755512}, {'name': 'Gratitude', 'score': 0.037922099232673645}, {'name': 'Guilt', 'score': 0.00023694071569480002}, {'name': 'Horror', 'score': 0.0002850347082130611}, {'name': 'Interest', 'score': 0.3084111511707306}, {'name': 'Joy', 'score': 0.005850089713931084}, {'name': 'Love', 'score': 0.0017337946919724345}, {'name': 'Nostalgia', 'score': 0.008374562487006187}, {'name': 'Pain', 'score': 0.0005836741765961051}, {'name': 'Pride', 'score': 0.019035806879401207}, {'name': 'Realization', 'score': 0.20919150114059448}, {'name': 'Relief', 'score': 0.03439120948314667}, {'name': 'Romance', 'score': 0.0006632751901634037}, {'name': 'Sadness', 'score': 0.0014278190210461617}, {'name': 'Sarcasm', 'score': 0.011929919011890888}, {'name': 'Satisfaction', 'score': 0.22987842559814453}, {'name': 'Shame', 'score': 0.0008615041733719409}, {'name': 'Surprise (negative)', 'score': 0.008857762441039085}, {'name': 'Surprise (positive)', 'score': 0.04133295640349388}, {'name': 'Sympathy', 'score': 0.007729904260486364}, {'name': 'Tiredness', 'score': 0.0018989023519679904}, {'name': 'Triumph', 'score': 0.03762553259730339}], 'sentiment': [{'name': '1', 'score': 0.01932510919868946}, {'name': '2', 'score': 0.09415555745363235}, {'name': '3', 'score': 0.11722620576620102}, {'name': '4', 'score': 0.15553434193134308}, {'name': '5', 'score': 0.27580779790878296}, {'name': '6', 'score': 0.10464252531528473}, {'name': '7', 'score': 0.12186112999916077}, {'name': '8', 'score': 0.06550054252147675}, {'name': '9', 'score': 0.020424112677574158}], 'toxicity': [{'name': 'identity_hate', 'score': 0.0030525631736963987}, {'name': 'insult', 'score': 0.0019690701737999916}, {'name': 'obscene', 'score': 0.0018790934700518847}, {'name': 'severe_toxic', 'score': 0.0022197244688868523}, {'name': 'threat', 'score': 0.0030061714351177216}, {'name': 'toxic', 'score': 0.006297819782048464}]}]}]}}}], 'errors': []}}]\n",

However, I had take the responsibility on myself and had to have a reap tone when dealing with the customer and to kinda show them that this was an error with the booking system itself, not with the reception. And, eventually, they understood and we were able to book a new room for them, And one such situation from my time has a, support engineer would be when I initially joined the role, I did not know that layouts of the entire application of the pitfalls of the application I was working on, and I had of really high your tense call with a customer, since their transactions were not processed at a specific date. I had to get help for my senior support stuff and also convince them of the technical difficulties why they could not do, and there was nothing that could be done at the moment and if they allowed us two days of time, we would, enable the transaction and that this will not... This would not happen in the future. And the customer was convinced and they continue to use our software from their own.
